You can turn to drugs, but ibuprofen won’t cut it and you’ll probably end up on prescription narcotics. Good luck not getting addicted.

"This subreddit is hilarious. I found this sub like a year ago when this ""roasting"" thing became internet popular, and I left after a week or so when every semi-attractive girl got told the exact same things about her. Daddy issues, shallow, no personality, insecure, gold-digger, vapid, some insults about her eyebrows and makeup. Every post, without fail,  the same comments

Come across this sub again from an /r/bestof post and surprise, this ""omg the most epic roast in this sub's history"" was basically a conglomeration of the same stereotypes this place was giving girls over a year ago

And then to top it all off, this girl is a ""fashion model"" who knew how this subreddit would react to her pics and would get her a shit-ton of attention. And, like clockwork, she starts posting about it on her Instagram because she got the attention she always wanted and this place gave it to her, and of course makes her post about in a lingerie shot with her boobs and ass out in the open.

She even says ""Yes, I did ask for this"" because she knew what would come from it, and this subreddit gave her what she was seeking and is too stupid to recognize it. She'll probably get even more Instagram followers and modeling work strictly because of this.

Great work fam.",1499,RoastMe

"You look like someone who has been carrying a heavy mental load on their back for their entire life. There’s stress and a heaviness in your eyes even in your first picture, OP. 

Other commenters shared a link to another post you made, OP. As someone who has also struggled through childhood trauma, please know that therapy and trauma work based around CPTSD has been monumentally helpful for me. 

If therapy isn’t an option right now, I can recommend some books and subreddits. It’s morbidly comforting knowing how many others can relate—to not feel alone with the struggles of trauma. 

CPTSD: From Surviving to Thriving by Pete Walker (this book helped me put into context the lasting affects trauma had on me. I realized my brain was reacting in a way to protect itself and how it’s still using the same system to “try to keep me safe” now as an adult. 

The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel Van der Kolk (this book helped me understand why I developed fibromyalgia and why I hold so much tension. Why my body would react in certain ways aka panic attack when I *thought* there was nothing bothering me)

Understanding the Borderline Mother by Christine Ann Lawson (I haven’t read this one personally but a lot of commenters on r/raisedbyborderlines have felt validated by reading this)


Running on Empty by Christine Musello and Jonice Webb (this book maps out about a dozen different circumstances in which a parent’s over-action, negligence, smothering, etc lead to internalized trauma that can well...leave you feeling running on empty all the time. Many times it’s not just one example but the parent checking off many examples. Having the cause and effect laid out clearly like this helped me again reinforce that my trauma is not my fault)


Hold Me Tight by Sue Johnson (I haven’t read this one personally but my therapist has recommended it to me. She said it focuses on attachment styles. Our upbringing affects how we later form relationships with others. If it was unstable growing up, it may be difficult to form stable relationships as an adult. I for one can certainly agree with how accurate this is)

I’m 27 this year, OP. You’re only a few years older than me. We’re both young and we both have our lives ahead of us. The future is uncertain, but you’re not moving forward in it alone. 

I’m so sorry your past was not your own. Give yourself the space and time to grieve that—it’s more than valid. I believe in your resiliency, OP. I believe you can accomplish your goals. I have a feeling you’re feeling a lot like Atlas or Sisyphus right now with the pain you’re carrying. 

It’s okay, you can rest, mend, and eventually the boulders will become smaller and smaller once you chip away at them. Eventually the boulder will become a big rock that might need help lifting from a friend. Eventually the big rock will become a heavy stone that will tire you, but you worked on practicing healthy lifting forms and knowing when to take breaks for yourself. And eventually the the heavy stone will become something manageable. It might take the form of a small pebble in your shoe that keeps popping back up. But it’s okay, you’ve worked on recognizing on when you’ll need to bring tools for the big rocks or boulders, when you can recognize when you’re lifting the heavy stone so you know when to put it down, and how to take the pebbles out of your shoes without losing your shoe too. 

I believe in you OP. I hope you can believe in yourself, too.

"Background: I’m the middle of a divorce that is almost finalized. She loves her boss. This week was the first week we had the joint custody schedule and yesterday was my first day.
As soon as I ate lunch, I went into the most excruciating pain I’ve ever felt. It like my stomach was of needles. I managed to get someone to watch the kids while I barely made it to the ER, where they told me my intestines were twisted and blocked and I would need surgery right away. My ex-wife didn’t wish me good luck or anything.
I had my most pathetic moment too. I came out of anesthesia and immediately started sobbing and asking where my wife was. For ten years we had each other’s backs, and now I’m just discarded. And to make things worse, I have to stay here for a few days, so I just miss my whole first week with my kids. I’m heartbroken.

Edit: I’m overwhelmed by all of this. Thank you all. I’ve read and continue to read every single comment. Thank you to the people offering encouragement. Double thank you to the people sharing their own pain - it helps me more than you think. And special thanks to everyone saying I’m attractive and have nice hair. That actually touches really close to home. My ex used to make comments about “when I had nice hair” and stuff and it really got to me. I was convinced I was balding, 30 something, with kids — not exactly the best catch in the world. So thank you for giving me some confidence back.",2650,ToastMe

A year after graduating I got my first job, at a movie theater. This was the first time I had my own money, so I started buying a lot of fast food.........and BOOM just like that, all that hard work I did to lose weight, cane right back in 3 months.

Let's begin with this

*LOUD APPLAUSE*

Two years!! That's two years of being brave enough to stay alive a little longer, that is inner strength,courage and sheer determination to fight your demons and that is some serious warrior might right there.

As for College I know its heart wrenching and a feeling of failure....I say it's just a bunch of colleges not worth going to because they couldn't see your potential and that's their loss.

Friends will come in time but now is your time to grow, time to heal, time to master yourself.

I wish for your mental health I could say one day will be cured but I have it too and that would be a lie BUT... we can learn to fight it, master it and stop it from making us bow to it, instead in time we might make Mental issues our bitch, who knows but you are a fighter two years says so.

Keep fighting, keep battling because you survived and that is because you deserve to be here, you are stronger and better than what you think.

Stay strong, keep battling because you are an inspiration to others who feel like quitting.

You will win in the end.",328,ToastMe

It only goes up from here. I swear. My thirteenth year in this planet was probably my worst ever. But I'm here now, and I can tell you, it only goes up. It gets so much better, especially when you reach highschool. I cannot emphasize this enough. It gets better.

So, give life a chance for another few years at least, you hear? You're like, in the first paragraph of the book of your life. Read a little more before you decide you don't like it. Okay? 😉

Also, don't feel in a rush to date anyways. I'm not saying this because of your family situation (which sucks, I'm sorry,) but because your age is just not the right time to date. Trust me on this one. I've been there, it sucks. The dating pool in school is really really small. It's not worth it lol.

"Yesterday I saw my friends dad give him a hug and he genuinely said “I love you buddy” this really shocked me, just the idea that people act that way and it seems kinda silly looking back that it was a surprise but I think it can really make a difference to the world.  
You could be just like that person, you can break the chain and make the world a genuinely better place just by sticking around when times seem tough. (Sorry if I went on a bit of a tangent)

I also think that you mean a whole lot more to people than you think. At times when I’m feeling really down I often think that everyone hates me but there are moments when I can tell that someone is happy that I’m there or that I’ve made their day slightly better just for a moment. 

I don’t really know where I went with this but it’s really important that you try your very hardest to push through the moments when everything seems pointless because it can only go up from there. Also remember that you are worth more than you think, even if you struggle to genuinely believe this just try to remember it because it’s true.

I hope you do well in the future and if things seem really tough and you don’t think you can talk to anyone about it my inbox is always open to you!",246,ToastMe

Hello everyone we are here today to toast /u/mailovely. They have gone through a lot of personal struggles and come out on the other end thriving.

Much like Andy Dufresne in Shawshank Redemption, you’ve likely crawled through a mile of shit and come out clean on the other end. Congratulations on your better life.

Cheers to your new job. Cheers to the Ellis Reddings you’ve found that give you love. Cheers to how far you come. Especially if it felt like crawling through a mile of shit.

Every time you clean up it works to heal the neurological side of your addiction that some substances can destroy. Your brain is remembering how to connect to natural sources of dopamine, serotonin, etc. like delicious food, warm affection from others, showing compassion and forgiveness. Even the sunshine.

"I hope you find all the success you want in ceramics! I know this is a Toast Me, but as a holder of a BFA in Ceramics who is now a successful oncology nurse, I just want you to know that there are nearly zero jobs in ceramics. Unless you are incredibly driven and resourceful, it will be very very difficult to make money, much less enough to have things like health insurance, a nice house, financial security, etc. I know 7 ppl from my ceramics class who are still trying to make it work after 8 years and none of them contribute a significant amount to their household income. The ones that are single are either scraping by with odd jobs or rely on their parents.

My wife and I met in art school (she did graphic design) and after graduation, I had no plan nor any means to make ceramics/money. I wound up bartending and seeing my mom go through breast cancer before deciding I needed to do something to provide for myself and my family. Now Im a registered nurse with an amazing career caring for other ppl, have exceptional health benefits that are essentially free and live a very comfortable happy life. My hope is to keep ceramics in my back pocket until later in life when it is practical.

I am proud of you for pursuing your dreams, but I encourage you to at least take courses in marketing and/or business to help increase your chances of success as an artist. The reality is that we all need money, but that doesn’t mean that we have to sacrifice our dreams. There is a middle ground and they likely won’t teach you that in art school. I remember when they told us that 80something % of art students end up not doing art after graduation, I scoffed. I was elected leader for our thesis class (The Merry Mullberries, I might add), “I’m pursuing my dreams!!”, I yelled at them in my head. But reality hit after graduation and I had to make something happen. Don’t get blindsided by having nothing to do after graduation.

I hope you find your success and I’m proud of you for pursuing your dreams! If you want to talk about it, PM me. As someone who has been exactly where you are now, I know the conflicted feelings you’re having and can totally relate. Have a great weekend!

"Yesterday ￼May 24, 2017 at approximately 5 PM I was brought to the emergency room at UMass Memorial hospital in Worcester Massachusetts￼￼￼. Life would never be the same!

￼The￼ Hat Trick Of Anniversaries

Three Years Sober 

I was diagnosed with a terminal progressive disease. On May 24 & 25, 2017, I was so addicted that I got high by freebasing heroin right in my hospital bed.  

On the morning of May 25, 2017, a team of six neurologists came in to tell me that the word progressive means this will only get worse and that I would have roughly 6 months to live. They told me if I continued to use substances I would accelerate this timeline and make things much worse. Later that day I realized I knew what I needed to do and that I wanted to get clean from everything and fight for my life. I wanted to live. I chose to live.

When you are addicted to a powerful drug you rationalize idiotic ideas to yourself. They seem rational at the time but they are not. Since the doctors told me that this disease was caused by inhalation, I figured that it would be okay if I only sniffed it going forward.; idiotic idea. As my disease progressed, I could have easily went back to my old ways but I resisted the urge. I decided to choose a new path. 

It is a fact that when I was locked in, it would have been impossible for me to do drugs on my own, but there are people who would have helped me. I chose not to contact them. Many people may think that during my recovery, it would have also been impossible to get drugs because I was in a hospital. Let me assure you that if a person wants something bad enough they can make it happen but I chose not to and I continue to choose that every day. 

I’m very happy to be alive and I am ecstatic that I am sober from everything including cigarettes for 3 years now!!!💪🏼💯😀

Post-traumatic growth (PTG) is a theory that explains this kind of transformation following trauma. It was developed by psychologists Richard Tedeschi, PhD, and Lawrence Calhoun, PhD, in the mid-1990s, and holds that people who endure psychological struggle following adversity can often see positive growth afterward.

"I'm a 19-year-old, but last year I was in community college and I got a job as a math tutor. I met a woman who was in her 80s (I believe 85-6) and I always felt out of line when tutoring her because she was my elder. Throughout the quarter, we got closer and I found out she avoided math because her elementary/middle school math professor would sexually assault his female students, and she had avoided it since. But I can tell you now, as an outsider, we were far more proud of her for trying again then thinking ""you're so old, you should know this"". 

You're never too old to learn something, you're never too old to hone a skill- be proud that you persevered this far and keep going!",162,ToastMe
"I’m seeing a lot of people commenting on how good looking you are and it’s true you are but this may be isolating you in a way because people feel that you must know this about yourself or even assume that you are arrogant or that life is easier for you. You may also feel that that is what people like about you which can feel hollow like nobody is seeing the real you. Counterintuitive you people may not give you compliments figuring you must already know this and women more likely play it cool around you and be as naturally friendly. 
Because of your good looks people may not see your vulnerable side. Have you tried to tell them how you are feeling? Reach out- sometimes people don’t know you are missing them or need them. 
Do you have anything you love and interests? I suggest following those passions and the people you meet there you can bond over that and not just the superficiality of you being good looking. I think having someone love you for your personality is very healing.  I’m wishing for you so much love and healing as you move past this heartache. It will get better!!!",162,ToastMe

You aren't required to accomplish anything by a certain age, just keep moving forward. Always make mental health your number one priority.

"Hey brother. I've been here before. It hurts, everything does. Every touch, every thought, every move hurts. You're allowed to be sad right now and you're allowed to ask for help. You are! That's what this post is. Good job dude! But here's the thing. These literal and figurative wounds you have, they need time to heal. It's going to be frustrating when some take longer. But cut yourself some slack! It's a process and not a linear one. Sometimes shit gets worse before it gets better. Some moments will be harder, and then some will get easier.

Try and cultivate that little bit of good in your life when you find it. Let whatever bad comes, wash over like a burst of rain. It will all pass. Don't even bother giving it more headspace than it deserves. You've lost a lot, but I want you to remember, whatever you take with you now will be stronger and more resilient than ever! 

You've got this bud. Heal up, go hug your kids, eat some good food, call your mom, and then be ready for things to get better! They will. So so SO MUCH BETTER. You'll just have to trust the random internet stranger =) much love",113,ToastMe

We stay connected during the week and game together. Our bond is stronger than ever and my wife builds me up and supports. She's so smart and kindhearted with 2 wonderful boys of her own. Now we're a blended family of 6 and I'm fortunate and so lucky. 
But I appreciate all the support and advice you guys gave! I'm not good at receiving compliments on this because I don't think it's not something to celebrate. I should've never let myself get there. But anyway- from the bottom of my heart, I thank you guys. You guys are awesome!",82,ToastMe

"Hi, hon:

I would like to give you some resources that have helped me immensely - maybe they will give you some skills at combatting the depression and anxiety too:

- [The Work, by Byron Katie](https://thework.com/): four simple questions that will help you train yourself to identify and challenge negative or incorrect self-talk

- [Johann Hari’s TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/johann_hari_this_could_be_why_you_re_depressed_or_anxious?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare): new information about depression and the fact that it is a very complex issue, and requires a complex approach to resolve it - for example, meds and therapy are only two of a whole pile of tools that need to be used in your self-care skillset 

- [Adverse childhood experiences](https://acestoohigh.com/got-your-ace-score/): new information about how childhood trauma affects our mental and physical health, and how to start putting some changes in place that might help 

- [Start Where You Are, by Pema Chodron](https://pemachodronfoundation.org/product/start-where-you-are-book/): a book by a Buddhist nun about coming to terms with “what is”

One of the most difficult things you are going to have to master as you go into your 20’s is how to start putting complex self-care into place for yourself.  You must advocate for your own happiness and mental health. This means you have to ignore the mental and emotional numbness and take action. This is serious life-work.

Take small steps to:

- eat well (lots of vegetables!)
- get good sleep
- connect with meaningful work (paid or volunteer)
- connect with a wide community of people who can love you, and whom you can love
- get physical exercise (yes, I see the chair... but you only need to google disabled sports to come up with some inspiration on how to incorporate physical activity in some way)
- get your meds and talk therapy in place

Look for things that sing to your heart - for example, did you know that you could volunteer at some hospitals to cuddle babies? That your local animal shelter would love help walking the dogs? That your local shelters or food banks would be *thrilled* to have a wide range of help? That your local hospice or seniors centres would also love volunteer help? You could search out your local training centre for service dogs and ask if you can help them train the dogs, or even take on a dog!

These are hard things to do. They will *really* take you out of your comfort zone.  But they will help address the numbness. 

You look like a lovely, sweet human.  You also look like you are not using yourself to your fullest potential, and I want to **challenge you** to take the next steps in your growth as a human.  The world needs people like you to engage with it, to help us build community with each other.

You’ve got this, young man.  I believe in you!",82,ToastMe

"You're in touch with who you are and aren't afraid to be that - perhaps it gives the unfortunate side effect of either expecting others to know too, or else expecting others to take the slightest effort into empathizing with you. Those can be painful assumptions in the workplace (or at home when both partners are under stress) but will always serve you well amongst your friends. 

In the coming days, sagittarius, i see you preparing your thoughts beforehand on paper, and working on prompt delivery (even though you shouldnt have to explain these things). Its gonna feel gratifying, even badass at times.

"as a transwoman still in the closet myself, this shit is tough, buddy. i know it may be no consolation to you now, but honestly, seeing you muscle through a lonely christmas gives me some of the confidence i’ll need to do it myself someday soon. the first christmases after coming out are always the hardest and loneliest, and that’s been the case for every LGBT kid i ever knew. making it though this holiday season is getting the toughest step out of the way first. christmas will get better, the season will get happier. the opening act in the life of a transwoman is a lot of bullshit, but just wait till act 2. the sun comes out— i’ve seen it in others, i know it for myself, and i know it for you too, buddy. keep pressing through, for all the friends and family you’ll make on the other side of this. you’re already kicking ass at this, even if it doesn’t feel like it yet. that payoff may have a delay, but it always comes. and you’re already doing a bang up job making your way there.

everyone’s already said how pretty you are, but i know as someone with dysmorphia that can be a hard compliment to take. i know it’s rough, but things can change there too. your eyes will grow less cruel, and you’ll see what other folks see in you in time. again, the sun comes out, just in a little while. and on a side note really do keep making shit happen with that hair and makeup game. like damn i hope i can pull off a look that great when my own time comes.

you’re doing great in a system stacked against you. and all that effort won’t go to waste— like a little flower, it may just take some time to bloom in rough soil. we’re all rooting for you, and our hope is well-founded.

Lastly, I encourage you to put something on the wall behind you. It doesn't have to be big, and it doesn't even have to be meaningful. It can be fun, whimsical, a postcard, a post-it. Whatever. Don't think about it too much. Just give yourself something or somethings visual, and if you do, well, post a picture here. We'd all love to see what comes next.",67,ToastMe

1) Be selfish. Look after yourself and anyone you love dearly. The rest no longer matter.

"First of all, love the sweater my dude. As someone who’s come from a household where I was verbally abused, I can feel a small portion of your pain. You are worth so much more than your family abused you into believing you’re worth. You deserve happiness. You deserve to be loved and feel loved. You’re not at fault for your ex’s death. You aren’t at fault for the abuse you endured. It’s not your fault. Please keep holding on. You’re doing great and I’m proud that you’ve made it this far. I know that every day might be a fight but it’s a fight worth having if that means that your light is still in the world <3",54,ToastMe
"First of all, you’re gorgeous.
Second, congratulations! You got this! If the Navy is anything like the army, everyone was trying to convince you to stay in because, “There are no jobs out there.” Good thing you didn’t listen and decided to pursue what you really want to do instead. I myself just got out of the army and am about to start school to be in IT.
Third, you are not defined by the mistakes you have made in the past, your worth is not dependent upon how others treat you, you are NOT your worst thoughts and even though you might not see it, you are dearly loved and your presence in the lives of those you love is priceless. As I type this I’m learning to accept these truths into my own life. I’m not going to pretend to know what you’re going through but looking through your post history, it seems like we’re going through very similar challenges on a day-to-day basis in regards to life. Proud of you for continually moving forward and taking steps to better your life instead of just rolling over and letting the emotions take you over. If nothing else, you are a fighter and you are a survivor. It may not seem like it because our challenges are invisible but everyday that you wake up and get out of bed and love your family, you win. Even if you didn’t accomplish everything wanted to that day, you. still. won. It’s not about not getting knocked down but not staying down.. fighting to get back up. And I know that down the line your daughter will thank you for getting up and fighting for her everyday! We got this. You already won today.",54,ToastMe

"First off, you're gorgeous and at 36, you look more like 26.

Second, I can assure you, things will get better if you focus on yourself. I was engaged three times before I finally got married—all three times, I was cheated on. But now, I'm with a great woman and we've been together 10 years. I was only able to put all the scars behind me when I stopped focusing on what happened to me and started focusing on what I could control, which was my reaction to it. I forgave myself for my mistakes, forgave them for theirs, and didn't let the fire keep burning within me. Healing starts from being kind to yourself, especially when you're on your own.

Stay strong and believe that brighter days are ahead, if you choose that for yourself. And we're always here in the sub if you need a glow up!",51,ToastMe

New places suck (especially when you don't know anyone but your ex-SO/ ez-SO's friends) but you can find your people later on as well, is not too late for anything yet! Keep on rocking, and may your smile be from happiness soon ❤",48,ToastMe

For those who said they've had similar experiences or if you've ever felt like life has gotten you down, stay strong friends. Even if it seems the world has given up on you, the world is wrong and who gives a fuck about what the world thinks. Love and take care of yourself because you deserve it!

I don't know you or what you're going through but remember that there's always hope even when there seems like none. No problem is ever too big for you to handle.  And reach out, make sure you have a support system in place, there's so many people who care about you that you often overlook when you're on the brink.  You still have life to live, so go out there and live that bitch!!!",46,ToastMe

Break ups are extremely hard & you’re going to feel crushed and lonely, but after awhile it will get easier & you can focus more energy on loving & building yourself up!

I have ridiculously low self esteem, have had a hard going life and was bullied all throughout primary school and high school, part of the reason was my looks, so I appreciate you all.

"Hi, I kinda stalked your profile and it seems like you don't have much support at home, you should try things that distract you from depression, meds can help but most anti depressants have long term side effects, try an outdoor activity or something that keeps you out of home and distracted from your phone, not gonna lie it's really difficult to start and to find something you like, but, in my experience, works better than meds, meditation also works or you could get a notebook and write how you feel to relieve some stress, also could try writing how you would like to feel ( I'm brave, I'll keep going on) something like your own mantra, you have to do this thinking/ writing/ speaking in present. If you have suicidal thoughts start doing exercise or drawing, or something that takes these idea away. 
This thing's have worked for me, I hope it does the same to you if you give it a chance, best of luck!",37,ToastMe

I haven't had a month exactly like that, but I have had everything blow up at once.  This is obligatory, I suppose; but having been through similar situations, I can tell you it's true:

It gets better.

Seriously.  There's no particular reason why this is happening, it won't happen again, and there's nothing anyone could have done to predict and/or prevent it.

I know it sucks.  Again, sorry.  I also know it's a fluke.",37,ToastMe

I toast your courage and conviction, self determination and willingness to try new experiences. All of which are so very much more important in absolutely every way.

Dating is hell, but you are really pretty, and just from the very little I know about you I know you you have important and admirable qualities (e.g., courage, strength), so I have a feeling you won’t be alone long if you don’t want to be. Lastly, I empathize with the sadness and loneliness. Solitude can be a time for growth, though growth is always painful.

While I have been very lonely and hit with waves of depression, I think I'm handling it all surprisingly well. It's mostly the stress of such a big life change that's getting to me. Maybe that's a sign that this is all for the best. I believe a better relationship is out there. I'm just a little worried about starting over at my age. I was going to put it in the title, but I'm 29. Most people I know around my age are already married and having kids.

"I've been struggling with scarring alopecia since I was about 16. It really sucks sometimes knowing that I can't magic my hair back, but I've taken the opportunity to do absolutely whatever the heck I want with it. I dyed it cotton candy pink and had a blast! Soon it'll hit the point where I'll just shave it off and commit to wigs, so I'm planning a big party with some friends where we do as many wacky things with my hair as we can before I cut it off.

You've got a wonderful personality, a sparkle in your eye and a zeal for life. If your hair makes you feel isolated, or different, or less than, that's a reasonable feeling. I get it, trust me.

"First of all a PhD program is tough. It's admirable that you even attempt this because you are literally contributing to the body of knowledge in your field of study. This is not something that everyone can put on their resume. So thank you for making the world a little bit more familiar.

Secondly, getting married, having kids, and buying houses is overrated. It sounds awesome when other people go through that, but I assure you that these things are more complicated than a PhD program. In other words, lots of people think they want these things, but once they get it - it's not as glamorous as it seems.

In addition, people who get those things (marriage, kids, mortgage) also have to work towards these goals, and the challenges dont end once you achieve them (especially raising kids). Everyone gets to choose what they want to do with their lives - some people put their effort in finding a partner, others focus on saving for a home, and another set of people invests their time and energy into a PhD program.

All this to say that although you still dont have these things, you are excelling in the area you chose to focus on, and you are doing great! You already know that the first couple of years of the PhD program are tough, so it's good you're approaching the half-way mark.

Lastly, you can still have all these things after you defend your dissertation! But it's a lot harder to start a PhD when you already have a mortgage and kids to support.",30,ToastMe

Sigh, I'm not sure what to offer as a toast here, so forgive me if I mess this up...

You're nearing the end of your journey, shorter than you expected, shorter than you hoped. Many people don't know the end is coming, though, and just stumble unwittingly into the void. That will not be you. Most people think death is far away, and busy themselves with trying to keep it so, so much that it consumes their life. You have been freed from this burden, granted the knowledge that the reaper is coming soon and there's nothing to be done. This means that all your remaining life is yours, the world can claim no more obligations of you. Your time is yours now, to be spent only on you and the people you want to share it with. 

I'm so glad you have a loving husband to share these last moments with. I hope you can fill them with meaning. I wish we could offer you more, but we all know we can't. It's up to you now, and your husband, to find meaning and happiness in the time you have. You have no other responsibilities beyond that, no one could reasonably ask more of you.

So farewell, Miss Raincloudoshanna, and thank you for sharing with us. From the lovely smile you shared last time, to even your sorrows now, we're glad we could be there for you, grateful for the snapshots of your beautiful life. Now go, go with your husband, and be happy for the rest of your days :)",28,ToastMe

Don't attribute anything special to those words beyond needing to know whether or not you have to worry about diabetes or something like that.  They're just people.

Also, for those who comment on my strength to keep going and better myself.  It did not come easy.  I have attempted suicide four times since 2001.

My career in IT doesn't remove my creative side. I still dabble in art. I still love it, I just happen to also like IT so I'm making money with that too. Plus, many companies (if you don't pursue art full time at first) only care that you have a degree, doesn't matter what it's in unless you're in a super specific role. Love the glaze on that mug. You're killin it. Don't doubt yourself with this decision when you clearly have so much talent.",20,ToastMe

If you need a freind feel free to shoot me a DM",18,ToastMe
"This might be weird but you have a really kind face. If I saw you in public your happy face would make me happy too!

"Those that mind don't matter. And those that matter don't mind. But seriously my dude...there's nothing wrong with you appearance. Hell, I'd love to have that much hair again. LOL I have hair, just not that thick and full. I can't speak for your personality because all I see I is a fairly happy kid, so your personality doesn't stand out in this pic. 

We all have our demons to face and crosses to bear in life. Some more than others. Take it from an old fart..you got it going on for you so keep hitting for the fences. In comparison, I have grand mal seizures and chew my tongue regularly. For this reason I do not wear my partials any more because they become a hazard. So when I smile, or talk, all you get to see is my ugly, toothless mouth. I'm sure I look like a homeless crack head to some. But I am fortunate to be alive, and am fortunate to have what I do.

I know it's easy to sit here are tell you 'chin up my dude'. But after 65 years on this planet, I can tell you that what is important is in your heart and the drive you have to succeed beyond those things that you feel are holding you back. Break on through to the other side and don't let others get in the way of your dreams and ambitions.",18,ToastMe

"I'm so, so sorry for your loss. I can't imagine what you must be going through. Grieving is such a horrible process, it's so, so painful - but please keep in mind that however you grieve is valid. Try and reach out to people if you can, share memories with people who knew him or tell us on Reddit about him. Or, scream into pillows, or go for walks in nature or whatever works for you. This is horrible but you will endure.

My family isn’t too far from Atlanta so our news feed keeps giving us all reports about it. Good luck!! I hope you get that hug soon. Stay as safe as you can!

You've made it through things others cannot imagine, and you are understandably tired and hurting...but the tiredness and pain will not be forever.  You will have joy, success, and achievement going forward.  Believe it!

...and you have already had achievement...you've made it this far, which is really saying something!

A suggestion: I am chronically depressed, and when I feel my worst, I try to help someone else feel better. It usually makes me feel better than directly trying to make myself feel better, and even if it fails, I know I did something good.",16,ToastMe
Congratulations!,16,ToastMe
"Shit, girl, you keep going!!! Amazing! Every day is one step further away from that life. I've got 13 years clean from meth and coke, and I won't lie, it was hard at first, but the best thing I did was to get away from the people who brought me down. Focus on yourself and do things to make you feel happy and surround yourself with anyone and everyone you can find who supports your sobriety. You can do it! It might sound cliché, but finding hobbies and fun shit to do sober is actually cool. You don't realize how much you miss out on when you're high. This is life starting over new for you and it can be an exciting adventure. DM me if you ever need to talk. I have been there. You are strong and you can beat the dragon.",16,ToastMe

One day, your kids will grow up and they'll understand, as adults themselves, what you're going through now. They'll think back and be amazed at how strong you were, how loving you were to them, and they'll respect you immensely for everything you did for them even when you were suffering and in pain (the physical and emotional pain).

"As someone whose family was creepily posessive over my hair, I am so happy for you. Cutting my hair was the most liberating thing for me. And for you to even do a step more and getting a buzzcut is something I dream of doing, but afraid of judgement. I admire your commitment and ability to still do it anyway despite the circumstances you are in. That takes an incredible amount of strength. And in case someone hasn't said it yet, I am so proud of you. I don't know what gender you are because I don't want to assume, but if you identify as a woman know that is so powerful for women, or even people in general, to choose what to do with their own bodies. You look so lovely and thank you for allowing yourself to be vulnerable to strangers on the internet. There is so much strength in vulnerability. Trust me when I say this, cutting your hair is something you wont regret. Keep your chin up lovely because you did nothing wrong. 

On a lighter note, the amount of money you will save on hair products will be sooo immense. And also if you ever want to try out hair wigs those are so fun too because there is so much more variety with no danger of damaging your hair.",15,ToastMe
Hi my dude. I’ve got BPD & STDP so I know a little something about your struggle. But you’re a friggin rock star!! Look at you go!!,15,ToastMe
"Oh mate, don't ever stop being you and stay beautiful. Your eyes are the gateway to the soul as they say, and while you can tell there's been sadness there, yours still radiate so much wonderful energy along with your smile. 

The ex isn't even worthy of a mention but I have to say, more fool him. 

Keep going <3",15,ToastMe
your eyes are soooo pretty. Merry Christmas!!,15,ToastMe
"Omg. Look, This probably won't even get read but thank you soooo much. You guys are the nations backbone right now. I have so much respect for you. I know it isn't easy, and it can't be easy to take care of yourself at the moment. Even if it's just for a couple minutes, you have to do something for yourself a couple times a day.

A cup of coffee and silence, an hour YT session with your favorite content creator, grabbing your favorite candy, taking and animal for a short walk, etc.

I know this is totally not why you're posting, but on top of most likely being an incredible person, you are outrageously pretty and super cute! Like, aesthetically, you're no contest. I'll stop simping now.

May your path be filled with kindness and hidden blessings 🤗",15,ToastMe
Eyebags? You have good makeup,15,ToastMe
Hey lady! This was me about 7 months ago! Trust me life is so much better without them. It takes a while but you’ll enjoy it and love yourself so much more then your partner ever could.

💚❤️♥️💙💜,15,ToastMe
"You are too, handsome!",15,ToastMe
"When we're sad, we focus on negative emotions. It's ok to have a good cry, but just looking at these comments should assure you of the facts, which are that you're really pretty and lots of people think so. Even without knowing you I'm sure that you're a really cool person too!",15,ToastMe
You are doing awesome and I hope that mini you stays put as long as possible xxxxx,14,ToastMe
"I’ve been in recovery for about 4 years now, and I have to say that while it is hard, it’s so worth it! It takes time for your body to heal and you’ll find ways to appreciate what it does over time. I was able to give birth to my first child this year, and if I didn’t improve my relationship with food, it never would have happened. If I can do it, you totally can, too! Just keep at it and don’t give up. Life is so much more beautiful in recovery than I ever imagined and each day gets even better!",14,ToastMe
"1. Your make up is incredible, wish I had your skill
2. Degrees aren't everything, I did 2 in the hopes my life would improve but I would have been better off working up in the job I had. Now I work part time in a minimum wage job which isn't as good as the first job I ever had.
3. Hope you have help for your mental health",14,ToastMe
"Aha! I thought you looked familiar, and no wonder you do! I saw your post from that Goth flea market before, and your style/aesthetic rocks, so it's hard to forget!
Honestly, you seem pretty damn awesome, so just keep doing you, alright? Also. That makeup is 10/10. Good job on that gradient, it looks great!

And if things get bad, and you need someone to talk to, feel free to shoot me a message!",14,ToastMe
"I'm so heartbroken for you. I'm in tears seeing your face and picturing you so upset and feeling alone. I wish there were words that would help or solve this problem, unfortunately only time will. I'm sorry that there's nothing we can do to help with that feeling of loneliness except that with time you'll feel better. That doesn't help now, though, I know. What a great Dad you are that you went through all of this and your main concern is that you didn't get to see your kids for as long as you should have. You're a good person and I hope things turn around for you fast! Much love.",14,ToastMe
"If anyone is ghosting you, it's not because they aren't interested. They're either idiots, or completely intimidated by you. You're beautiful. You're a stunning person, and you're strong. Ending an abusive relationship is one of those things that people don't realize takes incredible strength. You did it.  
I'm so sorry about your friend. Losing someone like that is terrible. I hope you're able to find the peace your friend couldn't. Big hugs from me.",14,ToastMe
"Your hair is so bouncy! It has beautiful baby curls and looks super soft. I also think your makeup suits your face perfectly, especially the shape of your eyebrows! I honestly would describe your features as doll-like",14,ToastMe
You have a crazy gorgeous face. I bet you could pull off a short buzz. With your beautiful attitude you really don’t need anything else. I would choose to hang out with you over a thick haired person with a lame attitude.,14,ToastMe
"Man not many people survive that, but here you are.  Bold and brave.",14,ToastMe
"Hey, I just want to apologize to you, and the others in the comments mentioning similar experiences with the suicide hotlines. I volunteer my time to some of these, some of us really do care about you and wish you only the best. I'm sorry your experience makes you feel otherwise. 

OP, I hope you can stay strong tonight. You are so incredibly important regardless of whether or not you feel like that right now. Tomorrow is a new day, it might not be easier, but the hardest part is already over.",14,ToastMe
"You look so young and healthy! I like your tattoo, and that you appear to be naked in the photo.",14,ToastMe

"That’s amazing! Thank you for sharing. You’re not alone. I myself am well into my third year. No guarantees in graduating at this point, and I’ve felt very similar things for quite some time now. Needless to say, the fact that you are where you are today says a lot of great things about you, and everything else that you feel proud of in others is only a matter of time for you.",14,ToastMe
Good on you bro - if it gets hard remind yourself what future you would say.,14,ToastMe
Seven months is an incredible amount of time to last in the struggle against any addiction. I'm so proud of you for getting this far and I hope there are easier days ahead.,14,ToastMe

Your skin is literally glowing. Proud of you,14,ToastMe
"Your skin looks so amazing and clear! I can’t even see any scarring, are you using something that helps with that? As someone who’s had acne for nearing a decade I know all too well the feeling of “ill just see how my skin is doing before bed” and then twenty minutes later I suddenly realize my face is a bloody mess. Serious congratulations for breaking the habit, you deserve to feel only pride and no shame about your beautiful face!",14,ToastMe
I can’t imagine how hard that must be to carry. But you are strong and brave to have fought so hard. I hope this time with your husband is filled with love and joyful moments. Sending you boat loads of love.,14,ToastMe
"You are so strong and so unbelievably lovable. Don’t let this experience convince you otherwise. You will meet someone who cherishes you for you and will put just as much energy as you do into things. Take time to heal and when the time is right, they will walk into your life. 
Stay strong. 
Stay you.",14,ToastMe
"Better later than never! Fingers crossed man, you will nail it in May!",14,ToastMe
"Just curious, how do you ""neglect"" math when you take it some time during those years??",14,ToastMe
incredible. there's not nearly enough comments on this and I'm not good at Toasting so I'm unsure of what to say.,14,ToastMe
Boy!!! You cute af!,14,ToastMe
"Hey man, sorry to hear about all of this. The best advice I can give is the one I give myself when things get hard.. I try to focus and look forward to the man this is going to be make me, and I try to remember that life is never cruel to any one particular person. Therefore we take this pain, and we meld it into something positive. We take the lessons we can, and remind ourselves: ""I am alive. I can do this. I accept it will be hard, and nothing will change this, but I will overcome and I will be prepared.""  


I hope the rest of your month turns out better, my friend! Cheers from Germany!",14,ToastMe

"Shit. Here I am feeling blah because I feel lonely (been single for 12 years now) and I see your post. What I feel does not compare to what you're going through, but damn I felt that strong. 

&#x200B;

Easier said than done, but look at the other side of the tunnel. There is a bright light at the end of it. Even if the tunnel gets broken by boulders you can still navigate through it. Maybe not in a straight path, but there's always a way around it just to continue that journey.

&#x200B;

Someone better will come through. Without a doubt. First, recover from all this and rebuild yourself. Here's your chance to focus on yourself and your goals. Make yourself happy and love yourself. Once you're there keep going. If someone comes into your life it's ok to let her in, but don't undo what you've done to be happy and strong. 

&#x200B;

Again, easier said than done, but I have faith you'll get through this. Don't rush into anything. Take baby steps.",14,ToastMe

This is proof that weight loss is never just aesthetic (although you are extremely pretty, with an extra 65lbs or not), but I can see through this picture that you have determination and willpower and a fucking fighter in you.

Anxiety and depression sucks bad (I’ve had it for 9 years now) and still find myself stuck in a rut most times, but look how much courage you have! You are amazing and an inspiration!

I truly hope your days are filled with happiness from now on🥰",14,ToastMe
"I'm legit so jealous -- You pull off those glasses so well. They suit you so well omg.  
Like, I know the point of this subreddit is to intentionally post nice things, but I actually am so jealous you pull off those glasses like you do.

"I am so sorry this has happened to you, just know there is love in the world for you. Especially in your child, don’t ever forget that.",14,ToastMe
"A lot of people will say you'll eventually be fine. To get over it. That it's a blessing in disguise. That it's not the end of the world. 

Just know that your feelings are valid. You're allowee to feel sad. You're allowed to grieve. And if you ever need to talk to someone I will listen. Good luck out there, you're strong simply for posting this. Stay strong brave soul.",14,ToastMe
You’ve got this dude!,14,ToastMe

You have been acknowledged... appreciated even.  There's courage in sharing your current perils, proving you're looking out for yourself by seeking support.  That's a fantastic trait to prove your vigilance.  Since I don't know the details of your troubles, I can only cheerlead from the sidelines.  Keep pushing on.  Soon, you just won't give a F what trivial things idiots say to you.  When you've gotten to that point, you're damn near fearless.  I'm rooting for you.  You got this.",13,ToastMe

"What a shame that would have been. There are places and PEOPLE waiting for you to enter their lives and bless them. Im sure you heard this before, but suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem. There are new approaches and treatments now. Of course outward beauty doesn't heal the inner sadness because if it did, you'd never have a sad day in your life because you're beautiful. Embrace the treatments and do the work. You'll overcome and become stronger. Thank you for seeking out help. 😘😉",13,ToastMe

How many will shrink back in horror that they let themselves live in trepidation, under the heel of someone who saw them only as a means to an end?  You will get to smile in contentment in that moment. You've confronted your circumstances with honesty and bravery.  Carry that that thought close to heart - may it bring your courage and glory as you manifest your highest destiny.  Cheers!",13,ToastMe
"Hey. I'm so sorry you've been through all that. But you're still here. Every bad thing that has ever happened to you caught a fatal case of you before you caught a fatal case of it.

And here you are, in this shittiest situation of your life, and you're handling it like a badass! You made sure your kids are safe, and came out of surgery like a boss. That sobbing after surgery? You'll be laughing about it in a couple of months. We do very stupid things after surgery. I told my nurse in incredible detail about my period. He was not at all interested. 

And sure, it sucks that you missed your first week with your kids, but you have the rest of your life to spend with them. They love you and are probably worried about you. 

You are a badass, and are adulting like the best of them.",12,ToastMe

"I just passed 6 months,  and I honestly can't remember why I was a smoker and have no desire to go back. 






You. Can. Do.  This. 






Not another puff, not even one not ever.  That's how you STAY quit.






You're worth this struggle.",12,ToastMe
"As someone who smoked a pack and a half a day for many years and had failed on 8 different occasions (including 2 stints of over 6 months cold turkey before relapsing) before finally successfully quitting on my 9th try, I have some thoughts. First off, I would ask yourself what do you think giving in to the craving would “actually” provide you? Maybe a slight buzz, maybe. Is there anything of true value you would gain by giving in that would trump the feeling you are going to have if you resist? In addition to that, it’s important to keep in mind that there are going to be milestones that might trigger certain cravings. For me, 30 days and 3 months were always times that I felt tempted the most. I’m going to encourage you to not sacrifice what you really want long term for one fleeting empty moment of pleasure that you will almost inevitably regret immediately after. As someone who got to celebrate 12 years of no smoking on December 10th 2019, you will be glad you stayed strong. Reach out if you need. Fuck cigarettes. What other product if used as directed is going to kill you? Crazy stuff. You got this!",12,ToastMe

Keep reminding yourself, in the midst of this pain, that human beings are made for connection. Your heart will heal if you let it (with help if you decide you need it) and you will be free to love again. You will be wiser, and stronger, and able to choose a more worthy partner.

In the meantime, know you haven't done anything wrong. You're just a child who loves his parents and who's trying his best to remain positive. Also, know that I'm sure this is hard for your parents, too. It doesn't justify your dad, just something to keep in mind. 

Either way, you seem super grown-up and bright, and I'm sure you're a good influence to everyone you know! Keep it up and do everything you can to fill yourself with love, joy, and peace, you deserve it!",12,ToastMe

Shit gets rough and escape is altering my mind somehow. This just happens to be a hella addictive high and I'm persevering. Just got home from work a bit ago, smoked a joint and am just breathing for the first time today.  
  
I'll be back to this thread quite often in times of need, and I may not post am update ever because that's not something I feel like I'd enjoy, but if anyone wants updates ever please feel free to DM. I'm on this dang site daily after all.",12,ToastMe

"This is a tough moment for you right now. But there is a positive that you will see after some time has passed. This experience, bad as it is, is going to make you a stronger person. Six months from now. Maybe a year or more. You’re going to look back and see that this has lead to strengths you didn’t know you had. 

His leaving is absolutely shitty. But as tempting as it is to do so don’t beat yourself up over it. You have your son to focus on. Take this and use it to find the life you want. It may seem scary but there is a type of freedom for you in this. 

It’s going to be rough for a while but it will get better. YOU deserve better. When you’re ready you’ll find it.",12,ToastMe

I used to worry about colleges so much at your age and when I finally got in, I dropped out after a semester because the little part-time job I found to pay for my bills turned out to be my vocation. Please don't let some stuffy institutions define your success. The fact you reach out when you need a boost is really brave and shows a lot of character, self care is important!",11,ToastMe

"“Its unfair, especially by the time you’re about 30, your life’s become quite idiosyncratic. Say your life has 8 dimensions; family, friends, intimate relationships etc. you’re individually positioned in all of those dimensions, your life isn’t like anyone else’s life. So you see someone who’s ‘doing better than you’ its like you’re only seeing one dimension of them at once slice of time, so its not reasonable, you don’t have the whole picture; and then you get down on your self and you take the spirit out of yourself and you get bitter and resentful and theres nothing good about that.” - Jordan Peterson

TLDR: People’s ups and downs are so different on so many different dimensions, it doesn’t make sense to compare yourself to them.",11,ToastMe
"Whatever you do don’t give up on yourself, you’re absolutely beautiful and strong and CAN do this!! Try to treat yourself the way you would a best friend who’s going through a hard time, harsh words aren’t helpful, there’s no reason for the added negativity.

"Just some small advice as I went through basically the same weight goals, from 260 to around 180. You are doing it very smart, but when you get close to your goal it's easy to get caught up and try to make that goal a bit too quickly. Keep doing what you are doing, remember how far you've come, and don't rush it, because that can be very unhealthy for your body and mind. I was a wrestler and did that amount of weight loss in a grossly short time thanks to what essentially amounted to anorexia. That said, you are probably WAY smarter than me. So good luck, well done, and keep it up.",11,ToastMe
You’re doing amazing! The hard work you’ve begun will see it to it’s completion because you’ll see it through to the end! Keep on going!!,11,ToastMe

"Looking good there. 

Years ago I shaved my head to raise money for cancer. Selfishly, I just wanted to see how it looked then if I looked awful I could say ""it was for charity"". 

I mean i'm a guy so hair is hair, but definitely more manageable if you are bald or short hair. Its amazing. 

Hair is only a physical feature anyway. If you love baldness thats great. If you dont, it grows back. You can also start collecting wigs and make up quirky characters. 

Seriously, well done being cancer free.",10,ToastMe
