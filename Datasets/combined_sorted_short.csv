You can turn to drugs, but ibuprofen won’t cut it and you’ll probably end up on prescription narcotics. Good luck not getting addicted.

"This subreddit is hilarious. I found this sub like a year ago when this ""roasting"" thing became internet popular, and I left after a week or so when every semi-attractive girl got told the exact same things about her. Daddy issues, shallow, no personality, insecure, gold-digger, vapid, some insults about her eyebrows and makeup. Every post, without fail,  the same comments

Come across this sub again from an /r/bestof post and surprise, this ""omg the most epic roast in this sub's history"" was basically a conglomeration of the same stereotypes this place was giving girls over a year ago

And then to top it all off, this girl is a ""fashion model"" who knew how this subreddit would react to her pics and would get her a shit-ton of attention. And, like clockwork, she starts posting about it on her Instagram because she got the attention she always wanted and this place gave it to her, and of course makes her post about in a lingerie shot with her boobs and ass out in the open.

She even says ""Yes, I did ask for this"" because she knew what would come from it, and this subreddit gave her what she was seeking and is too stupid to recognize it. She'll probably get even more Instagram followers and modeling work strictly because of this.

Great work fam.",1499,RoastMe

"You look like someone who has been carrying a heavy mental load on their back for their entire life. There’s stress and a heaviness in your eyes even in your first picture, OP. 

Other commenters shared a link to another post you made, OP. As someone who has also struggled through childhood trauma, please know that therapy and trauma work based around CPTSD has been monumentally helpful for me. 

If therapy isn’t an option right now, I can recommend some books and subreddits. It’s morbidly comforting knowing how many others can relate—to not feel alone with the struggles of trauma. 

CPTSD: From Surviving to Thriving by Pete Walker (this book helped me put into context the lasting affects trauma had on me. I realized my brain was reacting in a way to protect itself and how it’s still using the same system to “try to keep me safe” now as an adult. 

The Body Keeps the Score by Bessel Van der Kolk (this book helped me understand why I developed fibromyalgia and why I hold so much tension. Why my body would react in certain ways aka panic attack when I *thought* there was nothing bothering me)

Understanding the Borderline Mother by Christine Ann Lawson (I haven’t read this one personally but a lot of commenters on r/raisedbyborderlines have felt validated by reading this)


Running on Empty by Christine Musello and Jonice Webb (this book maps out about a dozen different circumstances in which a parent’s over-action, negligence, smothering, etc lead to internalized trauma that can well...leave you feeling running on empty all the time. Many times it’s not just one example but the parent checking off many examples. Having the cause and effect laid out clearly like this helped me again reinforce that my trauma is not my fault)


Hold Me Tight by Sue Johnson (I haven’t read this one personally but my therapist has recommended it to me. She said it focuses on attachment styles. Our upbringing affects how we later form relationships with others. If it was unstable growing up, it may be difficult to form stable relationships as an adult. I for one can certainly agree with how accurate this is)

I’m 27 this year, OP. You’re only a few years older than me. We’re both young and we both have our lives ahead of us. The future is uncertain, but you’re not moving forward in it alone. 

I’m so sorry your past was not your own. Give yourself the space and time to grieve that—it’s more than valid. I believe in your resiliency, OP. I believe you can accomplish your goals. I have a feeling you’re feeling a lot like Atlas or Sisyphus right now with the pain you’re carrying. 

It’s okay, you can rest, mend, and eventually the boulders will become smaller and smaller once you chip away at them. Eventually the boulder will become a big rock that might need help lifting from a friend. Eventually the big rock will become a heavy stone that will tire you, but you worked on practicing healthy lifting forms and knowing when to take breaks for yourself. And eventually the the heavy stone will become something manageable. It might take the form of a small pebble in your shoe that keeps popping back up. But it’s okay, you’ve worked on recognizing on when you’ll need to bring tools for the big rocks or boulders, when you can recognize when you’re lifting the heavy stone so you know when to put it down, and how to take the pebbles out of your shoes without losing your shoe too. 

I believe in you OP. I hope you can believe in yourself, too.

"**Listen up motherfucker!** You will not give up, is that understood? I don’t care how shitty life is right now. I don’t care how hopeless and little light you find in it or in yourself. You will NOT give up!

Depression is the cancer of the mind. What you have is a disease, one that can easily cause your end just like any other cancer. The only difference here is fighting relies solely on you. So fight it! 

Every time you get a thought like “I am not good enough” or “The world would be a better place without me” that’s the cancer talking, not you. That is the disease dragging you thought by thought to places you shouldn’t be. 

**Do. Not. Let. It.**

Know your enemy. Identify these thoughts as such: The painful pangs of a disease. What you will do is tell these thoughts “Fuck you, no!”. Rationalise through them. “The world wouldn’t be better off without me. Because of me a bunch of heartless motherfuckers united into being kind. No one ever did that.”. Or “So and so sees the good in me. Why can’t I?”. Or something along those lines. Get creative. Have fun. 

And for fucks sake see a professional. Sure, you are strong and all but cmon man. Professionals are there for a reasons. Medicine might not have found a cure for what ails you, but it sure as shit has made big advances. 

More on talking to someone helps big time. The thoughts bouncing in your head all day start to come out and you see them in a different light. You also see your self and life in one narrow perspective. Talking to someone gives you a different one.

You are Russian, aren’t you? You vodka drinking bastards beat the second scariest thing to the cancer of depression: Nazis. So if your people can beat Nazis, you can beat this thing. Embody your russianness you beautiful, pasty bastard. 

Look I’m not going to lie and tell you doing a few of these things will magically make things rosey. They won’t. But your healing is a journey, one that can take a long time. 
You are who you are, own it. Know your strengths and work on the flaws that bother you. Adopt that mentality and you'll find with time you will grow to be a stronger person and a better man.
This shit will be hard. Like…real hard. On the good days things will be..meh. On the bad days you will fall back to old habits and wonder why the fuck should you keep going, it’s easier to just give up. Do. Not. Fucking. Give. Up. Do not let a temporary feeling define you. 

And one day, maybe in a year or 10 years, you will meet someone you fall madly in love with. Someone that makes you happy and want to do the impossible just to make them smile. You will then appreciate the painful personal growth you went through to become the man who deserves a woman like her. Or man, whatever. I don’t know what you like sticking your pencil dick into.
You will be proud of how far you’ve come, and you’ll want to go further. And if you have kids you will be filled to brim with hard-taught wisdom to pass on them. None of that will happen if you give up now.

So keep your chin up. You are not alone. You are loved. You are wanted. You are valuable. You are also balding. 

Many of these beautiful assholes offered you advice and a listening ear. I would like to humbly put my name on that list. If you ever need someone to listen, or just some good old though love, I’m a message away.

**P.S. You have a nice smile. But that track suit? Painfully stereotypical.**

I guess it goes to show, no matter how much money you have, no matter how famous you are or how many subscribers you have, you can still end up alone at home on Christmas day; the one day where family and friends are all supposed to spend quality time together.  Friends who are only there for the clout, and you know it. Family so sick of your bullshit they can't even spend Christmas day without being forced to throw you out into the streets, alone. Doesn't it say something when your parents would rather spend Christmas with an annoying, borderline autistic fucker (aka [Deji](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/pxnuR04AjRs/hqdefault.jpg)) than you? They actively chose to voluntarily have Christmas day with that [spazticated fuck](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/AxY0sGnw454/hqdefault.jpg) instead of you. Clearly they can see there's something wrong with you.

&#x200B;

You genuinely think you're a god. Maybe Deji is less retarded than you? What kind of god would choose to have hair so fucking shit it looks like a [crustified shit](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-swdglBNYrEc/U7V-5voDNMI/AAAAAAAABqg/A5OWJfyomB0/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/tales+from+poo+main.jpg).

&#x200B;

You must be a shit god. Think about it. Yeah you've got the subs. You've got the fame. You've got the money. But that's it. I have probably £400 to my name and I'm so much richer than you. I've got friends, really good friends. I've got a family who made sure I had the best Christmas I could. I've got siblings who would back my case against the world, and I'd do the same for them without a blink of an eyelid. And best of all, I'm happy. Deep down, we can all tell you aren't happy. You're beginning to realise that money can't buy happiness. I personally think it can to a certain degree, but the richest man can still be the loneliest.

The face you're pulling is literally the face Simon, Harry, Vik, Ethan, even fucking Callux is pulling at all your fucking stupid attempts to act like you're powerful. Creature was shit. Fucking hell, all your music is fucking dog shit. I find it hilarious that you try so goddamn hard to make the music decent, and your best efforts amount to fuck all. No matter how hard you try, ""Get Hyper"" will always be your best song followed closely by ""I'm on a horse"".

&#x200B;

KSI. As kids grow up, they'll stop laughing with you. They'll mature. They'll start to see how fucking pretentious you are, how much of an egotistical cunt you are. They'll despise you. They'll stop laughing with you and will start laughing at you, like the rest of the world. You might be getting youtube money but at the expense of your dignity and pride? Is it worth it?

Harry Potter and the Noscopers Stone was millions of times better than any video you ever made, bar ""I'm on a horse"". How does it feel that your best video featured you fucking a horse?

To conclude, you're a delusional, manipulative cunt. You think everyone looks up to you. They don't. Open those beady eyes. Start to accept the truth.

I for real  haven't been messaging you guys being all salty about the roast under the name ""Deniece."" Yes, someone knows my real name, but I've never gone by that and that's definitely not me. All the trolling points to that person though; that is some creative shit. 

No hard feelings from my end, all in good fun. Still love you guys. 😘

Oh and I obviously can't be completely sure, but I'm about 99.98% sure that I've never even met my ""ex."" All of the correct information he listed is readily available online if you do a little research, and the rest is off (my nipples are pretty awesome and I wax my bush). 🙂 Also, he didn't even spell my name right...

I can't blame you though. Looking into the mirror has to be torture. To know that what you are looking at (what you are as a person) is better off with the trash on than the trash off. 

&#x200B;

You're the type of person that dies in their apartment from some hoarding related death but isn't found until 2 weeks later because no one was looking for you. 

And when the neighbors are asked how they didn't notice the smell of a decaying body, they will say ""well, it always smelled like that.""

So for now, you rot. You rot like you always have and when that sad, gross, but also relieving day comes the only things the people around you will be able to truthfully say is that your looks matched your life. A sad life wasted away in your own filth (figuratively and literally) 

Have a good one, Oscar! Keep pretending this is you being ""different"" or ""quirky"" and ignore that fact that you gave up on your life a long time ago.

"Hey there my weighty friend. I see the only thing you've got a bigger collection of than swords is chins. I'd ask if you have a sword that big to compensate for a small dick but since you won't have seen yours since puberty how the fuck would you even know.
BTW, no fucking amount of that industrial strength deoderant you've got on the table there will begin to mask the odour that escapes the depths of your sweaty crevices but I'm sure people appreciate the token gesture. 

I assume your waving that phat sausage around in the hope that someone, somewhere has a sub roll thick enough to fit it in. Less chance of that than you reproducing. If you've never considered how unlikely that is let me help you..... First they have to find you attractive enough to hunt around through all those rolls to find your unwashed genitals. Then you'd have to have sufficiently healthy circulation to achieve an erection. Finally, if the stars aligned and those miracles occurred, you'd need the stamina to pump that crusty jizz out and I'd wager they aren't the most virile of little fellas. It would be like a giant picking up an old people's home and tipping them out of the chimney. 

Anyway. Nice to meet you and stay safe",47,RoastMe

I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit.

But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.

If your pig starts taking on a burnished color within the first  hour, you're going too fast. Either slow down the rate at which you are  adding coals, or raise the pig a few inches from the heat source (most  spits are also adjustable in height).

The last half hour is where all the skin-crisping crackly magic  happens, and requires high heat, so you'll want to pile on the coals at  the very end, rotating the pig as necessary to expose every inch of skin  to the intense blast of heat.

"Just because you've lost more than 90% of your eggs and every year that goes by you're more likely to be unable to have children doesn't mean you can't be happy.

I mean sure, it would be nice to have someone to pass on all your life experience to. Someone who looks up to you more than anything in the world. Someone who loves you unconditionally for the rest of your life, and will carry on your memory and your legacy into the future for potentially thousands of generations. 

But hey, you still haven't gotten a chance to hike Machu Picchu, and your traveling bucketlist is still so long. There are so many more instagram photos to take! Think of all those destination shots! Have you even been to the Swiss Alps yet?

Think of how much joy you will get from your instagram photos for the next 50 years. That is definitely going to make up for your lack of a family. Whenever you feel lonely you can just pop on to your timeline and scroll some old posts, I'm sure it will be very thrilling. Much more fun than seeing your daughter's first drawing. Her first time singing. Her first love. Her children, and your grandchildren. Those photos of that time you got plastered with that person who no longer has time for you will still be there for you to offer comfort.

He just had treatment  for prostate cancer, but was diagnosed  in 2009.  If you don't know why that is important  look it up. I was 46, and had no idea I would be giving up an essential part of  married life at such a young age.  But the vows were in sickness & in health,  for better or worse.  I also  possibly face the prospect of being alone for a long time.  My situation is not for everyone.  Your age difference  with your fiance is much greater than me and my husband's.   You should seriously consider what your future hopes, dreams, and goals are. If you are just marrying him for money, or you truly are planning on forever, you should  seriously consider what that future looks like when you are 30 and he is 60, and so on.  Believe me, the blue pill doesn't always work. You will have to decide if you are ok with that.

I will also tell you this. The things you want now will likely  change a great deal by the time you are 30. Don't rush into marriage.  It fixes nothing. Go live your life, have fun, and be with your kid. You only get one opportunity to raise the  child in a good, loving home.  You will blink and your child will be driving, and then graduating high school.  We all fuck up a little as parents. But you don't have to fuck up so badly, if you put the child's needs first.

"You probably wake up in the middle of every night, usually not being able to sleep again until the sun rises. The complete and utter silence (minus Hila's snoring) obliges you to finally face yourself and your thoughts after a long day of preparing handcrafted, Ethan Klein™ factory-made ""goofs"" and ""gaffs"" for your fans. But you don't want to be alone with yourself, you don't want the illusion to end; ""You're a happy boy, you're a happy boy, you're a happy boy"", you repeat to yourself. Your heart sinks, breathing becomes heavier, for you are not happy, nor a boy anymore. You nudge Hila, to see if she'll wake up. Still snoring. You don't dare nudge her again because you feel guilty of troubling her over and over again. Although it's a running gag, you think to yourself ""She's my carer and i'm a piece of shit"". Your heart feels another sting. You recall your shitty wedding proposal, the wiping, and the flashbacks come back. You didn't marry Hila, you imprisoned her. You rid her of years of her youth by continuously having to have her take care of you, a man-child. That's why you put on weight, babies are round and so are you. You get up and reach over to your phone, and click on the youtube application. You attempt to find comfort in the comments of your videos.  ""Love you Hila and Ethan. Thanks for the laughs"", you read, and it makes you smile. You navigate around. ""'Please don't divorce me'' Now that's how you sustain a relationship﻿"" was a top comment. You start breathing heavily. Your  throat feels raspy. You turn off the screen.

You walk to the kitchen to get some water. But then you see a bottle of that good stuff on the counter, about 2/5 full.   
""Might as well finish it."" It took you a few minutes, until you took another bottle. You turn the screen of your smartphone back on, try texting sean, shawn, idubbz (or however it's written) and pewdiepie. ""hey what's up"", you wrote. You realize you made it a group message and instantly said ""oh fuck u iz dumb boi h3h3"".  You scream silently and start moving around like shia laboeuf in that one viral video he had.  You play the h3h3 theme that majorleaguewobs made to shake it off. You act possessed, yet your eyebrows were moving to the beat of the song. You take a long mirror from the hall and pick it up and dance with it. You are dancing with yourself. You are having a stare off with yourself as you're dancing, and you make odd grimaces, thinking it's your doppelganger who's hating and provoking you. 
You start getting dizzy after 30 seconds and so you put down the mirror. You turn off your music and throw yourself towards your couches. You missed. You hit the floor. You pass out.

You wake up with this throbbing feeling ""wild night i must've had dawg"" you tell yourself as you stare at the ceiling. You turn to the side, and see the mirror. You see randy saying ""issa no from me dawg "". You wake up again, it was a dream. You get up and see a knife and recall that hot knife video you made and thought how you should try roasting beef with the knife. ""Haha wtf that'd be so funny"", you audibly say.
And then it hits you. 

""HEY HILA LETS TAKE THIS PIC AND PUT IT ON /ROASTME ON REDDIT COME DOWN, IT'LL BE OUR JUICIEST GOOF DAWG""

No answer. 
You run up to your room, write the roastee paper and wake up Hila, who was still snoring.

You take a selfie with her real quick and post it to reddit.

"Ok, I'm gonna be real here. You got into Harvard. You're already better than 99% of redditors, including those in this thread. And quite frankly most roasts here are weak. They reek of jealousy. Your future is looking bright while all these guys can do is call out your virginity. I bet this must be the happiest week of your life.

&#x200B;

Enjoy it while it lasts. Sure you got into Harvard, but are you truly happy? Do you have a sense of self-fulfillment, or are you just some smart kid who took a bunch of APs because your self-esteem is so low that you wouldn't dare to reach outside of your comfort zone?

&#x200B;

You know what's gonna happen once you get into Harvard? You look like the kind of kid who's gonna be all alone during pre-frosh weekend. You'll live in a dorm but never talk to your roommate. Or anybody for that fact, because you're an awkward fuck with no real interests and charisma. You'll take CS 50 and Ma23 or some shit that isn't quite Ma55 but not a beginner class either, and think you'll own it because you were the smartest kid at your school. Turns out you're a dolt, and that talent you had will get you nowhere because it's the equivalent of a basketball bencher at a mediocre DI college. After getting your ass kicked the first semester, you'll be taking the easiest classes because it's the only way you'll graduate with a degree.

&#x200B;

Impostor syndrome will hit you hard. You'll go to therapy every week and label yourself as yet another depressed millennial. Or Gen Z, whatever. Actually, you probably already do. I mean, you have 3.2 million karma which indicates some serious need for validation. But you're nowhere close to prepared for how intense that feeling will get.

&#x200B;

At the end of those 4 years, you'll feel empty. You'll notice that some people got great work done while all you did was reddit and study because you struggled to even get a passing grade. At best you're going to become another cog in the machine. Maybe you'll throw your life away at the first sign of a girl who tolerates you, because you're the kind of incel who thinks getting a girl is the greatest accomplishment imaginable.. The only way you'll get a Wikipedia page is if you become the next Unabomber. 

&#x200B;

The kids with \*real\* talent will change the world. But all you'll be able to say is that you graduated from Harvard. Granted, initially that'll pique the interest of a lot of people and you'll get some opportunities that you otherwise wouldn't have deserved. But as soon as they get to work with you they'll understand how pathetic you really are. 20 years from now, that degree from Harvard will add nothing to your resume. You're gonna go through a mid life crisis like everybody else. You're gonna be more lonely than anybody else. They say success is 10% IQ and 90% EQ. You've got 0 EQ, so prepare to be the smartest IT guy in some unknown company.",18,RoastMe

"I just want to take the time to thank the Reddit community and this subreddit. There was a lot of thought put into this post. The story goes like this, 

I had a cat scan to go to yesterday morning to see where my cancer is at. I am just finishing my 12th round of chemotherapy this year and it has been progressively worse each time. To be honest I have been running on fumes. Emotionally I have been a wreck and have struggled to find positive things in my life. 

I have thought about posting in this subreddit for a while, not because I am a sucker for abuse, but because I needed something to motivate me. I needed to have tougher skin, laugh at myself, and not take life so seriously. This roast ended up being so much more than that.

First, thank you to the people who roasted my ass. I wanted it and you did not let me down. I got so many laughs from you and appreciate it immensely. Next, to all those who sent me supportive words, stories, and inspiration. What you did for me I cannot explain in words. You have put a fire in me that was not there and I sorely needed, but did not realize. 

I had hundreds of DM's and comments from people who are fighting cancer(even my own kind), people who have family members going through it or have gone through it. I connected with some many people that gave me inspiration in my fight. This post and the people has created a life changing experience for me. Not only am I going to help myself now, but now I am focused on helping others in my shoes. 

Lastly, you all gave more attention to Leiomyosarcoma than I have ever seen. Don't underestimate the significance of awareness. You guys did something, that I could of never did alone. You guys flipped the script in r/roastme and showed love. Thank you for helping me break the internet.

"Dear u/PrincessLRBHSF,

We've had the opportunity to review your audition tapes and we are going to have to pass at this time. While, aesthetically, you fully embodied the character of Grimace as well as his ""well meaning slow wittedness"", we did feel as if you lived up to the name a little too well. Grimace is not actually supposed to grimace, and, most importantly, he should never make others grimace. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Not to mention three years ago I indicated to my very accredited OBGYN oncologist just exactly where my tumors were located. Finally the tumors were removed this year. I feel badly for you in that I totally get the BLOATED abdomen and weakness. All I can say is good luck and strength to endure what is ahead. My chances of another reoccurrence are 70 to 95 per cent.I doubt we will receive miracles. Try to just enjoy whatever you can.All I can do. At least you have a sense of humor.

Sign up for trials.  Write to researchers publishing white papers on your cancer.  Talk to survivors.  Talk to weirdos.  Laugh.   Laughter absolutely got me through a year long treatment.

> About those lifelong prayers... I’d always wanted curves.  You know... girly curves.  My figure was more Olive Oyl than Marilyn Monroe.    Along comes chemo:  boom!  60 pounds gained!  Great.   Now I look like a pumpkin on stilts.  But thanks to menopause I don’t care.  Much.  Sigh.

"Yknow I come to this subreddit because I hate myself and like to feel better about my terrible self image but Jesus Fuck I just feel sorry for you. Posting an image because your girlfriend told you to is pretty sad considering you're 17. I hate to break it to you but those high school relationships don't mean shit, although apparently neither did your safety or the consideration of others when you jumped off a fucking cliff so it's not like you'll be smart enough to listen to any advice I give you. I'll say this much; and hopefully you take the time to fuckin think on this. Don't be some roid built hard ass just because you're young, mommy bought you that apple watch and you have a girlfriend. I don't know when but with the way you're acting about what you're given you'll be dead within the next five years (if you're lucky). Grow the fuck up dude. I mean that sincerely. Grow the hell up and stop being some prick who thinks their a pretty boy. Take a step back before you decide to make any fucking decision in your life and think, ""Wait, I jumped off a fucking cliff, so maybe I should reconsider"" Either learn to grow up or start paying your girlfriend to watch over you and change your fuckin diapers. 
I mean this with love, you don't understand it now but I gurantee you that the people in your life give a shit, don't blow it and take the time to be with them while you can dude. Stupid stunts like that aren't going to make anyone respect you more. Spend time with the people you have and spend it thinking like an actual person. Imagine your girlfriend having to see a limp corpse sprawled out on the fucking water because you wanted to play stupid. I mean hey, in whatever shitty afterlife you believe in you could watch her get finger blasted by someone who at least gives a shit unlike you did apparently, at least she wouldn't have to worry about him jumping off a fucking cliff like you did. I couldn't imagine having to be anyone affiliated with you because they're a helluva a lot more tolerable to your bullshit than I would be. So love them while you can you prick. ",3,RoastMe

"Background: I’m the middle of a divorce that is almost finalized. She loves her boss. This week was the first week we had the joint custody schedule and yesterday was my first day.
As soon as I ate lunch, I went into the most excruciating pain I’ve ever felt. It like my stomach was of needles. I managed to get someone to watch the kids while I barely made it to the ER, where they told me my intestines were twisted and blocked and I would need surgery right away. My ex-wife didn’t wish me good luck or anything.
I had my most pathetic moment too. I came out of anesthesia and immediately started sobbing and asking where my wife was. For ten years we had each other’s backs, and now I’m just discarded. And to make things worse, I have to stay here for a few days, so I just miss my whole first week with my kids. I’m heartbroken.

Edit: I’m overwhelmed by all of this. Thank you all. I’ve read and continue to read every single comment. Thank you to the people offering encouragement. Double thank you to the people sharing their own pain - it helps me more than you think. And special thanks to everyone saying I’m attractive and have nice hair. That actually touches really close to home. My ex used to make comments about “when I had nice hair” and stuff and it really got to me. I was convinced I was balding, 30 something, with kids — not exactly the best catch in the world. So thank you for giving me some confidence back.",2650,ToastMe

Edit: things seem to be going faster than I would like. And so much of what happens here is a shot in the dark. None of the doctors or nurses know what is going to happen. But the bright sides are that I started the steroids early to help develop baby's lungs, magnesium can still be administered to slow down labor and protect baby's brain, and the nurse says he is so strong.

Let's begin with this

*LOUD APPLAUSE*

Two years!! That's two years of being brave enough to stay alive a little longer, that is inner strength,courage and sheer determination to fight your demons and that is some serious warrior might right there.

As for College I know its heart wrenching and a feeling of failure....I say it's just a bunch of colleges not worth going to because they couldn't see your potential and that's their loss.

Friends will come in time but now is your time to grow, time to heal, time to master yourself.

I wish for your mental health I could say one day will be cured but I have it too and that would be a lie BUT... we can learn to fight it, master it and stop it from making us bow to it, instead in time we might make Mental issues our bitch, who knows but you are a fighter two years says so.

Keep fighting, keep battling because you survived and that is because you deserve to be here, you are stronger and better than what you think.

Stay strong, keep battling because you are an inspiration to others who feel like quitting.

You will win in the end.",328,ToastMe

It only goes up from here. I swear. My thirteenth year in this planet was probably my worst ever. But I'm here now, and I can tell you, it only goes up. It gets so much better, especially when you reach highschool. I cannot emphasize this enough. It gets better.

So, give life a chance for another few years at least, you hear? You're like, in the first paragraph of the book of your life. Read a little more before you decide you don't like it. Okay? 😉

Also, don't feel in a rush to date anyways. I'm not saying this because of your family situation (which sucks, I'm sorry,) but because your age is just not the right time to date. Trust me on this one. I've been there, it sucks. The dating pool in school is really really small. It's not worth it lol.

"Yesterday I saw my friends dad give him a hug and he genuinely said “I love you buddy” this really shocked me, just the idea that people act that way and it seems kinda silly looking back that it was a surprise but I think it can really make a difference to the world.  
You could be just like that person, you can break the chain and make the world a genuinely better place just by sticking around when times seem tough. (Sorry if I went on a bit of a tangent)

I also think that you mean a whole lot more to people than you think. At times when I’m feeling really down I often think that everyone hates me but there are moments when I can tell that someone is happy that I’m there or that I’ve made their day slightly better just for a moment. 

I don’t really know where I went with this but it’s really important that you try your very hardest to push through the moments when everything seems pointless because it can only go up from there. Also remember that you are worth more than you think, even if you struggle to genuinely believe this just try to remember it because it’s true.

I hope you do well in the future and if things seem really tough and you don’t think you can talk to anyone about it my inbox is always open to you!",246,ToastMe

"It was people like you who allowed my grandma to peacefully and painlessly pass away next to my grandpa and one of her daughters holding her hands. 

It's people like you who allowed my dad to be next to his wife in the icu while she passed away. 

It's people like you who fought tirelessly to save my cousin's life while in a diabetic coma. Pumps, tubes, baths, medication, and support.

While our family members get sick and may die, it's people like you that allow us closure in their death and our life because people like you get to a breaking point and continue to give your knowledge, skills and humanity. 

It's people like you who give parents their children to embrace and hold again. 

I hope you take time to center yourself in these trying months. 

Thank you.",207,ToastMe

I cannot articulate how greatly sorry and heartbroken I am to hear about your rape and your consequent mental struggles, not to mention your cruel roommates. I hope your living situation has since improved. I hope you are able to aspire to a place where you never let yourself be degraded or abused again. You are worth so much more than that. And I hope you are able to find a good therapist, who is able to help you find healing and peace. What happened to you will never be justified or fair, but I truly hope you will find a way to become whole again. Sending you courage, strength, and love xx",206,ToastMe

"I hope you find all the success you want in ceramics! I know this is a Toast Me, but as a holder of a BFA in Ceramics who is now a successful oncology nurse, I just want you to know that there are nearly zero jobs in ceramics. Unless you are incredibly driven and resourceful, it will be very very difficult to make money, much less enough to have things like health insurance, a nice house, financial security, etc. I know 7 ppl from my ceramics class who are still trying to make it work after 8 years and none of them contribute a significant amount to their household income. The ones that are single are either scraping by with odd jobs or rely on their parents.

My wife and I met in art school (she did graphic design) and after graduation, I had no plan nor any means to make ceramics/money. I wound up bartending and seeing my mom go through breast cancer before deciding I needed to do something to provide for myself and my family. Now Im a registered nurse with an amazing career caring for other ppl, have exceptional health benefits that are essentially free and live a very comfortable happy life. My hope is to keep ceramics in my back pocket until later in life when it is practical.

I am proud of you for pursuing your dreams, but I encourage you to at least take courses in marketing and/or business to help increase your chances of success as an artist. The reality is that we all need money, but that doesn’t mean that we have to sacrifice our dreams. There is a middle ground and they likely won’t teach you that in art school. I remember when they told us that 80something % of art students end up not doing art after graduation, I scoffed. I was elected leader for our thesis class (The Merry Mullberries, I might add), “I’m pursuing my dreams!!”, I yelled at them in my head. But reality hit after graduation and I had to make something happen. Don’t get blindsided by having nothing to do after graduation.

I hope you find your success and I’m proud of you for pursuing your dreams! If you want to talk about it, PM me. As someone who has been exactly where you are now, I know the conflicted feelings you’re having and can totally relate. Have a great weekend!

"Yesterday ￼May 24, 2017 at approximately 5 PM I was brought to the emergency room at UMass Memorial hospital in Worcester Massachusetts￼￼￼. Life would never be the same!

￼The￼ Hat Trick Of Anniversaries

Three Years Sober 

I was diagnosed with a terminal progressive disease. On May 24 & 25, 2017, I was so addicted that I got high by freebasing heroin right in my hospital bed.  

On the morning of May 25, 2017, a team of six neurologists came in to tell me that the word progressive means this will only get worse and that I would have roughly 6 months to live. They told me if I continued to use substances I would accelerate this timeline and make things much worse. Later that day I realized I knew what I needed to do and that I wanted to get clean from everything and fight for my life. I wanted to live. I chose to live.

When you are addicted to a powerful drug you rationalize idiotic ideas to yourself. They seem rational at the time but they are not. Since the doctors told me that this disease was caused by inhalation, I figured that it would be okay if I only sniffed it going forward.; idiotic idea. As my disease progressed, I could have easily went back to my old ways but I resisted the urge. I decided to choose a new path. 

It is a fact that when I was locked in, it would have been impossible for me to do drugs on my own, but there are people who would have helped me. I chose not to contact them. Many people may think that during my recovery, it would have also been impossible to get drugs because I was in a hospital. Let me assure you that if a person wants something bad enough they can make it happen but I chose not to and I continue to choose that every day. 

I’m very happy to be alive and I am ecstatic that I am sober from everything including cigarettes for 3 years now!!!💪🏼💯😀

Post-traumatic growth (PTG) is a theory that explains this kind of transformation following trauma. It was developed by psychologists Richard Tedeschi, PhD, and Lawrence Calhoun, PhD, in the mid-1990s, and holds that people who endure psychological struggle following adversity can often see positive growth afterward.

I made a very anti-climatic slideshow that all air on May 26 my three year anniversary of sobriety

"I'm a 19-year-old, but last year I was in community college and I got a job as a math tutor. I met a woman who was in her 80s (I believe 85-6) and I always felt out of line when tutoring her because she was my elder. Throughout the quarter, we got closer and I found out she avoided math because her elementary/middle school math professor would sexually assault his female students, and she had avoided it since. But I can tell you now, as an outsider, we were far more proud of her for trying again then thinking ""you're so old, you should know this"". 

You're never too old to learn something, you're never too old to hone a skill- be proud that you persevered this far and keep going!",162,ToastMe
"I’m seeing a lot of people commenting on how good looking you are and it’s true you are but this may be isolating you in a way because people feel that you must know this about yourself or even assume that you are arrogant or that life is easier for you. You may also feel that that is what people like about you which can feel hollow like nobody is seeing the real you. Counterintuitive you people may not give you compliments figuring you must already know this and women more likely play it cool around you and be as naturally friendly. 
Because of your good looks people may not see your vulnerable side. Have you tried to tell them how you are feeling? Reach out- sometimes people don’t know you are missing them or need them. 
Do you have anything you love and interests? I suggest following those passions and the people you meet there you can bond over that and not just the superficiality of you being good looking. I think having someone love you for your personality is very healing.  I’m wishing for you so much love and healing as you move past this heartache. It will get better!!!",162,ToastMe

"I'm so very sorry!  Losing a parent is so hard.  It's clear in the photo how much he loved you.  Remember, it's ok to not be ok.  The first holiday without a loved one is always the hardest with Christmas and their birthday being the worst.  Be sad...cry...throw things...do whatever you need to do to take care of yourself.  Nothing is going to be the same again and that's how it is supposed to be.  You'll find your new  normal and your new happy in due time.  I went through this very same thing with my best friend and it took over a year for her to find her new normal and her new happy.  It WILL happen.

You are rocking those glasses and I bet when you smile, you light up a room.  I can tell from the ghost of a smile on your lips.",91,ToastMe

"My mom was a smoker for 2 decades, then quit. It’s been another 15 years since she’s quit, but her lungs are finally all cleared up again (goes to yearly exams with a lung specialist just to make sure). 

We’ve lost 2 family members to lung cancer so far. It’s an ugly way to go (I was in the ICU when my uncle died from emphysema & lung cancer — don’t do that to yourself). 

So you know what... here’s a toast to you, pal. I’m glad you’ve chosen to give yourself the gift of clear lungs too. The gift of a future that won’t be cut short from cigarettes. It might seem really hard right now, but you’ve got this. You have way too much ahead of you to worry about not being able to breathe.",89,ToastMe

"I have this too. Like everything, it ebbs and flows. Therapy and medication from psychiatrist has helped a lot. I'm 54F. Remember shame is about your perception of yourself.

Nuerontin/gabapentene is what has helped me the most.",85,ToastMe
"Keep going bro! The way you look is not you, who you are is in your mind and your soul and how you treat people. FUCK what other people may think, you are special and unique.

"UPDATE.....Whoa, thanks guys. I have literal tears rolling down my face. It's not something I tell a lot of people and I don't celebrate once a year but I always try to remind the boys that they're my heroes.
After that, I met my wife and moved a few towns away. I get my boys every weekend & half of summer break.
We stay connected during the week and game together. Our bond is stronger than ever and my wife builds me up and supports. She's so smart and kindhearted with 2 wonderful boys of her own. Now we're a blended family of 6 and I'm fortunate and so lucky. 
But I appreciate all the support and advice you guys gave! I'm not good at receiving compliments on this because I don't think it's not something to celebrate. I should've never let myself get there. But anyway- from the bottom of my heart, I thank you guys. You guys are awesome!",82,ToastMe

"Hi, hon:

I would like to give you some resources that have helped me immensely - maybe they will give you some skills at combatting the depression and anxiety too:

- [The Work, by Byron Katie](https://thework.com/): four simple questions that will help you train yourself to identify and challenge negative or incorrect self-talk

- [Johann Hari’s TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/johann_hari_this_could_be_why_you_re_depressed_or_anxious?utm_campaign=tedspread&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=tedcomshare): new information about depression and the fact that it is a very complex issue, and requires a complex approach to resolve it - for example, meds and therapy are only two of a whole pile of tools that need to be used in your self-care skillset 

- [Adverse childhood experiences](https://acestoohigh.com/got-your-ace-score/): new information about how childhood trauma affects our mental and physical health, and how to start putting some changes in place that might help 

- [Start Where You Are, by Pema Chodron](https://pemachodronfoundation.org/product/start-where-you-are-book/): a book by a Buddhist nun about coming to terms with “what is”

One of the most difficult things you are going to have to master as you go into your 20’s is how to start putting complex self-care into place for yourself.  You must advocate for your own happiness and mental health. This means you have to ignore the mental and emotional numbness and take action. This is serious life-work.

Take small steps to:

- eat well (lots of vegetables!)
- get good sleep
- connect with meaningful work (paid or volunteer)
- connect with a wide community of people who can love you, and whom you can love
- get physical exercise (yes, I see the chair... but you only need to google disabled sports to come up with some inspiration on how to incorporate physical activity in some way)
- get your meds and talk therapy in place

Look for things that sing to your heart - for example, did you know that you could volunteer at some hospitals to cuddle babies? That your local animal shelter would love help walking the dogs? That your local shelters or food banks would be *thrilled* to have a wide range of help? That your local hospice or seniors centres would also love volunteer help? You could search out your local training centre for service dogs and ask if you can help them train the dogs, or even take on a dog!

These are hard things to do. They will *really* take you out of your comfort zone.  But they will help address the numbness. 

You look like a lovely, sweet human.  You also look like you are not using yourself to your fullest potential, and I want to **challenge you** to take the next steps in your growth as a human.  The world needs people like you to engage with it, to help us build community with each other.

You’ve got this, young man.  I believe in you!",82,ToastMe

"You're in touch with who you are and aren't afraid to be that - perhaps it gives the unfortunate side effect of either expecting others to know too, or else expecting others to take the slightest effort into empathizing with you. Those can be painful assumptions in the workplace (or at home when both partners are under stress) but will always serve you well amongst your friends. 

In the coming days, sagittarius, i see you preparing your thoughts beforehand on paper, and working on prompt delivery (even though you shouldnt have to explain these things). Its gonna feel gratifying, even badass at times. 

Good luck with everything, and sorry if i overstepped my understanding. You're clever and kind and the world is better place with you in it.

"You have such a warm face, if you radiate such warmth and joy from a “forced” smile, you must shine brighter than the sun when you feel happy. 

I really hope that you do get to shine that bright soon. Anxiety and depression will lie to you that you shouldn’t feel happy, but you deserve to. If you need to speak to a therapist or get medication etc to help facilitate that, do it. Happiness is ahead of you.

I am truly sorry about what you have been going through, it is unimaginable.

"as a transwoman still in the closet myself, this shit is tough, buddy. i know it may be no consolation to you now, but honestly, seeing you muscle through a lonely christmas gives me some of the confidence i’ll need to do it myself someday soon. the first christmases after coming out are always the hardest and loneliest, and that’s been the case for every LGBT kid i ever knew. making it though this holiday season is getting the toughest step out of the way first. christmas will get better, the season will get happier. the opening act in the life of a transwoman is a lot of bullshit, but just wait till act 2. the sun comes out— i’ve seen it in others, i know it for myself, and i know it for you too, buddy. keep pressing through, for all the friends and family you’ll make on the other side of this. you’re already kicking ass at this, even if it doesn’t feel like it yet. that payoff may have a delay, but it always comes. and you’re already doing a bang up job making your way there.

everyone’s already said how pretty you are, but i know as someone with dysmorphia that can be a hard compliment to take. i know it’s rough, but things can change there too. your eyes will grow less cruel, and you’ll see what other folks see in you in time. again, the sun comes out, just in a little while. and on a side note really do keep making shit happen with that hair and makeup game. like damn i hope i can pull off a look that great when my own time comes.

you’re doing great in a system stacked against you. and all that effort won’t go to waste— like a little flower, it may just take some time to bloom in rough soil. we’re all rooting for you, and our hope is well-founded.

merry christmas, and God bless you, my friend.",70,ToastMe

And here's the thing--you deserve that, even if you're the only one who doesn't think so. If you can, be forgiving of yourself when you feel down. 

Lastly, I encourage you to put something on the wall behind you. It doesn't have to be big, and it doesn't even have to be meaningful. It can be fun, whimsical, a postcard, a post-it. Whatever. Don't think about it too much. Just give yourself something or somethings visual, and if you do, well, post a picture here. We'd all love to see what comes next.",67,ToastMe
"**Some instructions for your life:**

1) Be selfish. Look after yourself and anyone you love dearly. The rest no longer matter.

2) Do all the things you want to do. The rules of life no longer apply to you. You have a free pass.

3) Try to be positive (this is optional, of course), but always smile. It will leave a good image of you to loved ones and it will piss your haters off beyond belief.

4) Keep making those cakes. They look epic and I'll take one off your hands. :-)

Second, congratulations! You got this!

I myself just got out of the army and am about to start school to be in IT.
Third, you are not defined by the mistakes you have made in the past, your worth is not dependent upon how others treat you, you are NOT your worst thoughts and even though you might not see it, you are dearly loved and your presence in the lives of those you love is priceless. As I type this I’m learning to accept these truths into my own life. I’m not going to pretend to know what you’re going through but looking through your post history, it seems like we’re going through very similar challenges on a day-to-day basis in regards to life. Proud of you for continually moving forward and taking steps to better your life instead of just rolling over and letting the emotions take you over. If nothing else, you are a fighter and you are a survivor. It may not seem like it because our challenges are invisible but everyday that you wake up and get out of bed and love your family, you win. Even if you didn’t accomplish everything wanted to that day, you. still. won. It’s not about not getting knocked down but not staying down.. fighting to get back up.

"First off, you're gorgeous and at 36, you look more like 26.

Second, I can assure you, things will get better if you focus on yourself. I was engaged three times before I finally got married—all three times, I was cheated on. But now, I'm with a great woman and we've been together 10 years. I was only able to put all the scars behind me when I stopped focusing on what happened to me and started focusing on what I could control, which was my reaction to it. I forgave myself for my mistakes, forgave them for theirs, and didn't let the fire keep burning within me. Healing starts from being kind to yourself, especially when you're on your own.

Stay strong and believe that brighter days are ahead, if you choose that for yourself. And we're always here in the sub if you need a glow up!",51,ToastMe

"Hi, I kinda stalked your profile and it seems like you don't have much support at home, you should try things that distract you from depression, meds can help but most anti depressants have long term side effects, try an outdoor activity or something that keeps you out of home and distracted from your phone, not gonna lie it's really difficult to start and to find something you like, but, in my experience, works better than meds, meditation also works or you could get a notebook and write how you feel to relieve some stress, also could try writing how you would like to feel ( I'm brave, I'll keep going on) something like your own mantra, you have to do this thinking/ writing/ speaking in present. If you have suicidal thoughts start doing exercise or drawing, or something that takes these idea away. 
This thing's have worked for me, I hope it does the same to you if you give it a chance, best of luck!",37,ToastMe

It gets better.

I toast your courage and conviction, self determination and willingness to try new experiences. All of which are so very much more important in absolutely every way.

Dating is hell, but you are really pretty, and just from the very little I know about you I know you you have important and admirable qualities (e.g., courage, strength), so I have a feeling you won’t be alone long if you don’t want to be. Lastly, I empathize with the sadness and loneliness. Solitude can be a time for growth, though growth is always painful.

While I have been very lonely and hit with waves of depression, I think I'm handling it all surprisingly well. It's mostly the stress of such a big life change that's getting to me. Maybe that's a sign that this is all for the best. I believe a better relationship is out there. I'm just a little worried about starting over at my age. I was going to put it in the title, but I'm 29. Most people I know around my age are already married and having kids.

Soon it'll hit the point where I'll just shave it off and commit to wigs, so I'm planning a big party with some friends where we do as many wacky things with my hair as we can before I cut it off.

You've got a wonderful personality, a sparkle in your eye and a zeal for life. If your hair makes you feel isolated, or different, or less than, that's a reasonable feeling. I get it, trust me.

Secondly, getting married, having kids, and buying houses is overrated. It sounds awesome when other people go through that, but I assure you that these things are more complicated than a PhD program. In other words, lots of people think they want these things, but once they get it - it's not as glamorous as it seems.

In addition, people who get those things (marriage, kids, mortgage) also have to work towards these goals, and the challenges dont end once you achieve them (especially raising kids). Everyone gets to choose what they want to do with their lives - some people put their effort in finding a partner, others focus on saving for a home, and another set of people invests their time and energy into a PhD program.

All this to say that although you still dont have these things, you are excelling in the area you chose to focus on, and you are doing great! You already know that the first couple of years of the PhD program are tough, so it's good you're approaching the half-way mark.

Lastly, you can still have all these things after you defend your dissertation! But it's a lot harder to start a PhD when you already have a mortgage and kids to support.",30,ToastMe
Congratulations! I cant imagine how difficult of a time you've been having..I know it cannot be an easy task mentally or physically. You're obviously a very strong person!

However, now that she has done so, you do not have to worry about others finding out. You are free to be yourself. Be kind to yourself. Enjoy your life.

"I toasted you last time you were here, good to see you again, love what you did with your hair :)

Sigh, I'm not sure what to offer as a toast here, so forgive me if I mess this up...

You're nearing the end of your journey, shorter than you expected, shorter than you hoped. Many people don't know the end is coming, though, and just stumble unwittingly into the void. That will not be you. Most people think death is far away, and busy themselves with trying to keep it so, so much that it consumes their life. You have been freed from this burden, granted the knowledge that the reaper is coming soon and there's nothing to be done. This means that all your remaining life is yours, the world can claim no more obligations of you. Your time is yours now, to be spent only on you and the people you want to share it with. 

I'm so glad you have a loving husband to share these last moments with. I hope you can fill them with meaning. I wish we could offer you more, but we all know we can't. It's up to you now, and your husband, to find meaning and happiness in the time you have. You have no other responsibilities beyond that, no one could reasonably ask more of you.

So farewell, Miss Raincloudoshanna, and thank you for sharing with us. From the lovely smile you shared last time, to even your sorrows now, we're glad we could be there for you, grateful for the snapshots of your beautiful life. Now go, go with your husband, and be happy for the rest of your days :)",28,ToastMe

Point is, things might get tough, and they will, but you just need to keep pushing! Just like we did and secured our future. Not to mention that my father  was absent for six years after he left, and now owes us almost 10k euros. Yet we still are where we are now. Things get better, I know this from experience.

"Let me tell you something.  ""Mom"" and ""family"" ONLY denote genetics.  Don't attribute anything special to those words beyond needing to know whether or not you have to worry about diabetes or something like that.  They're just people.  If you met her on the street and you got to talking for a few minutes, would she be someone you'd want to continue to build a relationship with?  No?  Didn't think so.  So fuck her.  If you're in her house, then unfortunately she's your warden until you're old enough to legally gtfo.  Just do what she asks of you and save any money you can to get gone as soon as you're able to get out on your own.  If you're not under her thumb, there's literally no reason to continue having her, or anyone in your family who doesn't bat an eye at your sexual orientation, in your life.  I cut my mom off for years and you know what she did?  She went to therapy, asked me to go to therapy with her, worked on her shit and made the effort to get back into my life.  She's not perfect, but it's 1,000x better and it's ONLY because she put in the work.  I know how lucky I am, believe me, but you never know, love.  I love you and I'm so proud of you for taking the first steps to put you first.

I am a lesbian, I am 26 (pains me to say this, but twice your age) and grew up in a part of the U.K. that didn’t really have any LGBT* scene.

"Killin it!!! You have great bone structure and hair. It also warms my heart that you have friends that are supportive of you. You're absolutely beautiful inside and out.

Side note: Have you ever wondered over to r/curlyhair and gave the Curly Girl Method a try? It's a wonderfully supportive hair community that a couple other trans individuals frequent and it's been amazing watching them fall in love with their hair and themselves at the same time. Much love!",19,ToastMe

Life can be shit but with some help we'll just febreeze it to hell and flush the toilet and see the brighter side while making odd bathroom related metaphors. If you need a freind feel free to shoot me a DM",18,ToastMe
"This might be weird but you have a really kind face. If I saw you in public your happy face would make me happy too! I know you're struggling with depression, so if you don't want to smile for yourself, do it for others because your smile is contagious. Just fake it till ya make it, you're a good-looking guy and have nothing to worry about.",18,ToastMe
"Those that mind don't matter. And those that matter don't mind. But seriously my dude...there's nothing wrong with you appearance. Hell, I'd love to have that much hair again. LOL I have hair, just not that thick and full. I can't speak for your personality because all I see I is a fairly happy kid, so your personality doesn't stand out in this pic. 

We all have our demons to face and crosses to bear in life. Some more than others. Take it from an old fart..you got it going on for you so keep hitting for the fences. In comparison, I have grand mal seizures and chew my tongue regularly. For this reason I do not wear my partials any more because they become a hazard. So when I smile, or talk, all you get to see is my ugly, toothless mouth. I'm sure I look like a homeless crack head to some. But I am fortunate to be alive, and am fortunate to have what I do.

I know it's easy to sit here are tell you 'chin up my dude'. But after 65 years on this planet, I can tell you that what is important is in your heart and the drive you have to succeed beyond those things that you feel are holding you back. Break on through to the other side and don't let others get in the way of your dreams and ambitions.",18,ToastMe

"I'm so, so sorry for your loss. I can't imagine what you must be going through. Grieving is such a horrible process, it's so, so painful - but please keep in mind that however you grieve is valid. Try and reach out to people if you can, share memories with people who knew him or tell us on Reddit about him. Or, scream into pillows, or go for walks in nature or whatever works for you. This is horrible but you will endure. 

I always find [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/hax0t/my_friend_just_died_i_dont_know_what_to_do/c1u0rx2?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) about grief really powerful.

I’m not sure if you ever expected to have to deal with something like this when you started nursing, but it came. I know I’m very grateful for people like you who are rising to the challenge and doing their best to help people get better. My family isn’t too far from Atlanta so our news feed keeps giving us all reports about it. Good luck!! I hope you get that hug soon. Stay as safe as you can! I know it’s incredibly busy but it would be a shame to have a great nurse get sick because she ran herself into the ground.",17,ToastMe

"/u/lil_westie has some excellent words and they should be listened to.

You've made it through things others cannot imagine, and you are understandably tired and hurting...but the tiredness and pain will not be forever.  You will have joy, success, and achievement going forward.  Believe it!

...and you have already had achievement...you've made it this far, which is really saying something!

A suggestion: I am chronically depressed, and when I feel my worst, I try to help someone else feel better. It usually makes me feel better than directly trying to make myself feel better, and even if it fails, I know I did something good.",16,ToastMe
Congratulations!,16,ToastMe
"Shit, girl, you keep going!!! Amazing! Every day is one step further away from that life. I've got 13 years clean from meth and coke, and I won't lie, it was hard at first, but the best thing I did was to get away from the people who brought me down. Focus on yourself and do things to make you feel happy and surround yourself with anyone and everyone you can find who supports your sobriety. You can do it! It might sound cliché, but finding hobbies and fun shit to do sober is actually cool. You don't realize how much you miss out on when you're high. This is life starting over new for you and it can be an exciting adventure. DM me if you ever need to talk. I have been there. You are strong and you can beat the dragon.",16,ToastMe

Good job getting out of that rut! I don’t know how that feels (yet? I’m 14) but I can imagine the joy of getting such a great accomplishment and getting out of this bad spot! A bunch of people are proud of you, and good luck at work! Best of wishes to you!

(I’ll probably pray for you as well, take care dude, that is something to celebrate for!)",16,ToastMe

This to shall pass you are working towards something that will better yourself and help your debt tremendously. 
I couldt imagine losing my cat so I get it, but take comfort in the fact (when you are ready) that there are so many cats needing to be adopted or feral that need to be taken care of and helped. You will one day agian when you are ready to put that love into another furry Lil one and love them maybe not just the same but in a diffrent way that will fill your heart in the greatest way.

You remind me of the property brothers from HGTV!
You have not yet found your tribe, but know this: there are so many good people in the world who don't know you, but still love and care for you. I run into people like this all the time, and I strive to be one myself and teach my students to do the same.

"I'm so sorry this is happening to you. You don't deserve it so don't let your mind wander into thinking it's your fault. Have you ever thought of it this way? One day, your kids will grow up and they'll understand, as adults themselves, what you're going through now. They'll think back and be amazed at how strong you were, how loving you were to them, and they'll respect you immensely for everything you did for them even when you were suffering and in pain (the physical and emotional pain). Let your future kids be your inspiration to push through this dark time! Hoping the best for you 💙",15,ToastMe
"Good for you, my friend! I am glad that everything came together as it did for all of you. I am also glad you are upholding your promise; the boys need their father now and far into the future.

"I know it can be difficult but don't compare where you are in life to what others are doing. You're working hard, and yes it is difficult but you should be even prouder of that! You can and will get through this and you might not feel fulfilled right now and that's okay, but your hard work will pay off. For now, find things to be happy about. You are incredibly handsome and you have beautiful smile and kind eyes, I wish you all the happiness🌸",15,ToastMe

"As my bud in arms once said, ""you're not poor you're just broke."" It's a mind game and Dave Chappelle makes being broke one of the funniest and awkward things to live with. It's groovy to hear things are coming around and man, there is much support here. Congratulations on getting through college and being resourceful! Enjoy the paycheck! Man, what kind of freelance are you doing? If you don't mind me asking",15,ToastMe
"As someone whose family was creepily posessive over my hair, I am so happy for you. Cutting my hair was the most liberating thing for me. And for you to even do a step more and getting a buzzcut is something I dream of doing, but afraid of judgement. I admire your commitment and ability to still do it anyway despite the circumstances you are in. That takes an incredible amount of strength. And in case someone hasn't said it yet, I am so proud of you. I don't know what gender you are because I don't want to assume, but if you identify as a woman know that is so powerful for women, or even people in general, to choose what to do with their own bodies. You look so lovely and thank you for allowing yourself to be vulnerable to strangers on the internet. There is so much strength in vulnerability. Trust me when I say this, cutting your hair is something you wont regret. Keep your chin up lovely because you did nothing wrong. 

On a lighter note, the amount of money you will save on hair products will be sooo immense. And also if you ever want to try out hair wigs those are so fun too because there is so much more variety with no danger of damaging your hair.",15,ToastMe
Hi my dude. I’ve got BPD & STDP so I know a little something about your struggle. But you’re a friggin rock star!! Look at you go!!,15,ToastMe
"Oh mate, don't ever stop being you and stay beautiful. Your eyes are the gateway to the soul as they say, and while you can tell there's been sadness there, yours still radiate so much wonderful energy along with your smile. 

The ex isn't even worthy of a mention but I have to say, more fool him. 

Keep going <3",15,ToastMe
your eyes are soooo pretty. Merry Christmas!!,15,ToastMe
"Omg. Look, This probably won't even get read but thank you soooo much. You guys are the nations backbone right now. I have so much respect for you. I know it isn't easy, and it can't be easy to take care of yourself at the moment. Even if it's just for a couple minutes, you have to do something for yourself a couple times a day.

A cup of coffee and silence, an hour YT session with your favorite content creator, grabbing your favorite candy, taking and animal for a short walk, etc.

I know this is totally not why you're posting, but on top of most likely being an incredible person, you are outrageously pretty and super cute! Like, aesthetically, you're no contest. I'll stop simping now.

May your path be filled with kindness and hidden blessings 🤗",15,ToastMe
Eyebags? You have good makeup,15,ToastMe

"You are too, handsome!",15,ToastMe
"When we're sad, we focus on negative emotions. It's ok to have a good cry, but just looking at these comments should assure you of the facts, which are that you're really pretty and lots of people think so. Even without knowing you I'm sure that you're a really cool person too!",15,ToastMe
You are doing awesome and I hope that mini you stays put as long as possible xxxxx,14,ToastMe
"I’ve been in recovery for about 4 years now, and I have to say that while it is hard, it’s so worth it! It takes time for your body to heal and you’ll find ways to appreciate what it does over time. I was able to give birth to my first child this year, and if I didn’t improve my relationship with food, it never would have happened. If I can do it, you totally can, too! Just keep at it and don’t give up. Life is so much more beautiful in recovery than I ever imagined and each day gets even better!",14,ToastMe
"1. Your make up is incredible, wish I had your skill
2. Degrees aren't everything, I did 2 in the hopes my life would improve but I would have been better off working up in the job I had. Now I work part time in a minimum wage job which isn't as good as the first job I ever had.
3. Hope you have help for your mental health",14,ToastMe
"Aha! I thought you looked familiar, and no wonder you do! I saw your post from that Goth flea market before, and your style/aesthetic rocks, so it's hard to forget!
Honestly, you seem pretty damn awesome, so just keep doing you, alright? Also. That makeup is 10/10. Good job on that gradient, it looks great!

And if things get bad, and you need someone to talk to, feel free to shoot me a message!",14,ToastMe
"I'm so heartbroken for you. I'm in tears seeing your face and picturing you so upset and feeling alone. I wish there were words that would help or solve this problem, unfortunately only time will. I'm sorry that there's nothing we can do to help with that feeling of loneliness except that with time you'll feel better. That doesn't help now, though, I know. What a great Dad you are that you went through all of this and your main concern is that you didn't get to see your kids for as long as you should have. You're a good person and I hope things turn around for you fast! Much love.",14,ToastMe
"If anyone is ghosting you, it's not because they aren't interested. They're either idiots, or completely intimidated by you. You're beautiful. You're a stunning person, and you're strong. Ending an abusive relationship is one of those things that people don't realize takes incredible strength. You did it.  
I'm so sorry about your friend. Losing someone like that is terrible. I hope you're able to find the peace your friend couldn't. Big hugs from me.",14,ToastMe
"Your hair is so bouncy! It has beautiful baby curls and looks super soft. I also think your makeup suits your face perfectly, especially the shape of your eyebrows! I honestly would describe your features as doll-like",14,ToastMe
You have a crazy gorgeous face. I bet you could pull off a short buzz. With your beautiful attitude you really don’t need anything else. I would choose to hang out with you over a thick haired person with a lame attitude.,14,ToastMe
"Man not many people survive that, but here you are.  Bold and brave.",14,ToastMe
"Hey, I just want to apologize to you, and the others in the comments mentioning similar experiences with the suicide hotlines. I volunteer my time to some of these, some of us really do care about you and wish you only the best. I'm sorry your experience makes you feel otherwise. 

OP, I hope you can stay strong tonight. You are so incredibly important regardless of whether or not you feel like that right now. Tomorrow is a new day, it might not be easier, but the hardest part is already over.",14,ToastMe

What you are doing is so incredibly brave and impressive. You should be so proud of yourself! I hope all goes well for you in the future for you and your baby!! Best of luck!,14,ToastMe
"That’s amazing! Thank you for sharing. You’re not alone. I myself am well into my third year. No guarantees in graduating at this point, and I’ve felt very similar things for quite some time now. Needless to say, the fact that you are where you are today says a lot of great things about you, and everything else that you feel proud of in others is only a matter of time for you.",14,ToastMe
Good on you bro - if it gets hard remind yourself what future you would say.,14,ToastMe

Your skin is literally glowing. Proud of you,14,ToastMe
"Your skin looks so amazing and clear! I can’t even see any scarring, are you using something that helps with that? As someone who’s had acne for nearing a decade I know all too well the feeling of “ill just see how my skin is doing before bed” and then twenty minutes later I suddenly realize my face is a bloody mess.

"Hey man, sorry to hear about all of this. The best advice I can give is the one I give myself when things get hard.. I try to focus and look forward to the man this is going to be make me, and I try to remember that life is never cruel to any one particular person. Therefore we take this pain, and we meld it into something positive. We take the lessons we can, and remind ourselves: ""I am alive. I can do this. I accept it will be hard, and nothing will change this, but I will overcome and I will be prepared.""

Easier said than done, but look at the other side of the tunnel. There is a bright light at the end of it. Even if the tunnel gets broken by boulders you can still navigate through it. Maybe not in a straight path, but there's always a way around it just to continue that journey.

&#x200B;

Someone better will come through. Without a doubt. First, recover from all this and rebuild yourself. Here's your chance to focus on yourself and your goals. Make yourself happy and love yourself. Once you're there keep going. If someone comes into your life it's ok to let her in, but don't undo what you've done to be happy and strong.

Again, easier said than done, but I have faith you'll get through this. Don't rush into anything. Take baby steps.",14,ToastMe

And here you are, in this shittiest situation of your life, and you're handling it like a badass! You made sure your kids are safe, and came out of surgery like a boss. That sobbing after surgery? You'll be laughing about it in a couple of months. We do very stupid things after surgery. I told my nurse in incredible detail about my period. He was not at all interested. 

And sure, it sucks that you missed your first week with your kids, but you have the rest of your life to spend with them. They love you and are probably worried about you. 

You are a badass, and are adulting like the best of them.",12,ToastMe

You. Can. Do.  This. 






Not another puff, not even one not ever.  That's how you STAY quit.






You're worth this struggle.",12,ToastMe
"As someone who smoked a pack and a half a day for many years and had failed on 8 different occasions (including 2 stints of over 6 months cold turkey before relapsing) before finally successfully quitting on my 9th try, I have some thoughts. First off, I would ask yourself what do you think giving in to the craving would “actually” provide you? Maybe a slight buzz, maybe. Is there anything of true value you would gain by giving in that would trump the feeling you are going to have if you resist? In addition to that, it’s important to keep in mind that there are going to be milestones that might trigger certain cravings. For me, 30 days and 3 months were always times that I felt tempted the most. I’m going to encourage you to not sacrifice what you really want long term for one fleeting empty moment of pleasure that you will almost inevitably regret immediately after. As someone who got to celebrate 12 years of no smoking on December 10th 2019, you will be glad you stayed strong. Reach out if you need. Fuck cigarettes. What other product if used as directed is going to kill you? Crazy stuff. You got this!",12,ToastMe

Keep reminding yourself, in the midst of this pain, that human beings are made for connection.

In the meantime, know you haven't done anything wrong. You're just a child who loves his parents and who's trying his best to remain positive. Also, know that I'm sure this is hard for your parents, too. It doesn't justify your dad, just something to keep in mind.

Everyone is right, I am definitely strong enough to do this, and have been, but I'd be a liar if I said I didn't want to so I could not feel sober right now. Shit gets rough and escape is altering my mind somehow. This just happens to be a hella addictive high and I'm persevering. Just got home from work a bit ago, smoked a joint and am just breathing for the first time today.

His leaving is absolutely shitty. But as tempting as it is to do so don’t beat yourself up over it. You have your son to focus on. Take this and use it to find the life you want. It may seem scary but there is a type of freedom for you in this.

Say your life has 8 dimensions; family, friends, intimate relationships etc. you’re individually positioned in all of those dimensions, your life isn’t like anyone else’s life. So you see someone who’s ‘doing better than you’ its like you’re only seeing one dimension of them at once slice of time, so its not reasonable, you don’t have the whole picture; and then you get down on your self and you take the spirit out of yourself and you get bitter and resentful and theres nothing good about that.” - Jordan Peterson

"Just some small advice as I went through basically the same weight goals, from 260 to around 180. You are doing it very smart, but when you get close to your goal it's easy to get caught up and try to make that goal a bit too quickly. Keep doing what you are doing, remember how far you've come, and don't rush it, because that can be very unhealthy for your body and mind. I was a wrestler and did that amount of weight loss in a grossly short time thanks to what essentially amounted to anorexia. That said, you are probably WAY smarter than me. So good luck, well done, and keep it up.",11,ToastMe

Years ago I shaved my head to raise money for cancer. Selfishly, I just wanted to see how it looked then if I looked awful I could say ""it was for charity"". 

I mean i'm a guy so hair is hair, but definitely more manageable if you are bald or short hair. Its amazing. 

Hair is only a physical feature anyway. If you love baldness thats great. If you dont, it grows back. You can also start collecting wigs and make up quirky characters. 

Seriously, well done being cancer free.",10,ToastMe

"CONGRATULATIONS!! 

I've always told people to not be afraid to quit and start something new, especially when your mental health is involved.

Back in the day, i worked in a high end print shop. I made an incredible amount of money, but the stress that came from dealing with 'powerful' bank execs demanding their quarterly portfolios and spastic grad students (and so on) broke me. Had a nervous breakdown and everything, so THESE days, if someone is desperately unhappy in their work, i do my best to give them the emotional support they need.

It's hard to quit ties, but sometimes you just gotta be brave.

GOOD FOR YOU!!!",10,ToastMe

"I'd like to say that when I was younger, I was certain I was going to kill myself. So I set a date and set about making the last days of my life the best that I could. And soon, I didn't want to do it anymore. I realised how good life was.

I know your scenario isn't quite like mine but you should do what you love doing. Way I see it, we've all got a countdown. When we know when that countdown ends, we can't be blinded in fear by it. We've got to remember it and treat it as a deadline. Life's and essay and the last few days are when you've really got to do everything that you want.

My advice? Start spending time with loved ones more. Remember that you're still only human. Wishing you the best.",8,ToastMe

"Some people can’t pull off going from long hair to buzzed, but you certainly can. I love you vibe",8,ToastMe
"Your family has absolutely NO right to tell you what to do with your own appearance. Especially something as normal and routine as cutting hair. It grows back. Hopefully they will get used to it when they realise that throwing a childish fit doesn’t win back any of their perceived control over your bodily autonomy. 

Now to the compliments!! 

You look INCREDIBLE! I WISH i could pull off a buzz cut like this! Your jawline is fantastic, your skin is glowing, you have great eyebrows, and the minimalist haircut just shows off all of that perfectly. You look like an effortless combination of graceful and badass!

It’s not. 

They’ll try to tell you that you’re too young to know what you want. 

You aren’t. 

They’ll try to tell you what you feel isn’t real. 

It is.

You are perfect exactly as you are, baby girl.",8,ToastMe

You're obviously not going to let anything stop you, you're strong. Beyond that job, whatever you're going to go after in life, any other future goals, I have a feeling you're not lacking in the strength to take those oppurtunities. You're awfully gorgeous if that means anythint btw, just friend to friend.",8,ToastMe

"To begin with, I am so sorry for your loss! A fact is you will never be able to just forget about it and it will continue being a mental burden. You have to stay strong as  you have been. You have to do your best and try to accept that he is gone. Also it is clear he loved and cared for you from the one picture you have shown. Try to remember and be thankful for all the good times you had with him and ignore any falling outs. As I said before, don't try to forget him, instead treasure what he was.",8,ToastMe
Aw that picture is amazing.  He definitely loves the shit outta you.   The pain will always be there but the memories will outweigh the pain with time.  Keep making him proud.  Keep that chin up and remember he’s always watching.   Laughing when u stub your toe and encouraging you when you’re at your lowest.,8,ToastMe

Your hair makes me think of Jason Momoa,8,ToastMe
"I hate to hear about people struggling with anxiety and depression, especially someone so young. I don’t know much about you, but I know you’ve got some stuff going for you—you’re reaching out to people, you’re aware of your struggles, you’re someone who keeps trying even when it’s hard. All of this speaks positively about you and will only build your character over time. 

You’re not alone, you’re not hopeless. You’re worthy. You’re full of potential. You have value way beyond what you realize! You’ve suffered, which can give you unique understanding... who knows, maybe you are meant to help someone else on day?

"You cannot slide back. Because, you are a different person now. Do things now that are out of the ordinary, for you are not ordinary. Never stop growing.

(Yes yes, I am that English teacher who tries to read between the lines of what the author had implied lol)

Ghosting has become very common, sadly it is the easy way out for most guys and girls. You are adorably gorgeous lady working very hard to set up her own business.

Point is, don’t stress yourself out over other people and their irrelevant opinions. You know yourself better than anyone on the fucking planet and if you know you are doing your best, then that’s enough. You aren’t worthless and you aren’t a failure. As a living breathing being, you are worth something and that’s without your dedication and determination. You matter. Your life matters, and everything you do matters. Never forget that.

"You might not see my comment but I had to do the same thing nearly four months ago. My entire life has been redirected and oftentimes it feels weird that it happened. I put all of my love into the relationship and eventually they grew away from me and couldn’t reciprocate that same feeling. It’s going to hurt, a lot, and you’ll keep thinking about it. That’s the unfortunate truth. 

But I promise that you’ll get better, and while it might be a slow climb, it’s a climb nonetheless. Stay strong and trust that you’re best healer is going to be time. And most importantly, don’t be afraid to move forward with your life. While it can be a crazy new change, it’s important you take this time to focus on yourself, mentally, physically, and emotionally.

"I took a Philosophy of Sex and Gender class. One take away that I had was about marriage. This is a little subjective but it helps me sometime. 

Marriage is a product of patriarchal values. We are raised under a culture that expects us to get married and “settle down”. But that isn’t the way that we have to live our lives. There is nothing wrong with dating long term or even hooking up till you’re old and grey. Hell if you want numerous sexual partners and numerous romantic partners go you! 

Live the life you want to lead, romantically, emotionally, and physically! These things change over time so go with the flow. It won’t be easy, nothing emotional is. If it was easy then it wouldn’t feel as great when times are good. 

Good luck! Don’t give up!",7,ToastMe

If you had been married you may have been more miserable than had had the situation not gone this way. Reassure yourself that you’re ok. Relationships ebb and flow and aren’t continuous.

"That mug’s gorgeous.  The color composition is so mellowing and comfortable, and the pattern the glaze settled into is pleasingly mind-stimulating, like vague psychedelia.
It looks like you have a comfortable hand for shaping the randomness of the glaze(I imagine you get taught such technique with a ceramics degree?).
The shape of it flows in a weird(as in non-standard), pleasing way - and, is sensibly gravitational, with the bulb bottom. I appreciate that.

I know more than one person that (semi)supports themself with their ceramic art, but to be honest they all supplement that income somehow as well, either with a spouse’s income or some kind of hustling, wage or otherwise.

That’s art though, society doesn’t support it to be absolutely fiscally reliable.
But please dedicate yourself to making art, and feed it by doing what you love. Fight to do what you love if(when) you have you.

You studied something that means so much to you and can craft beautiful objects people are willing to spend a lot of money on (seriously what’s your page I want to buy a mug).

And they take out their unhappiness on nice people like you because of their own insecurities. Don’t think for a moment that just because they’re in charge, they know what they’re talking about. They don’t.  Deep breaths. Be your own best friend. Hang tight and things will get better.",6,ToastMe

"It takes a big leap of faith and bravery to leave a job. Finding a job is *so much* easier said than done. Good for you for putting your mental health first.

My former therapist gave me a good exercise at the beginning of each therapy session: 1. What happened? 2. What are your negative feelings about it? 3. What are your negative thoughts (e.g. “I’ll never find a job,” or “I’m not good enough”) ? 4. Why are those thoughts *irrational* (e.g. “They’re irrational because even if it takes a long time to find a job, I’ll find one eventually,” and “I know I’m good enough because I’ve had a job before and I have plenty of skills needed for a future job”) ?

This process always helped me when I was experiencing symptoms of anxiety or depression. I hope it helps you!",6,ToastMe

All I can say to find way having fun on your own, then you don’t miss others that much, it’s always better to have some company, but it’s not always an option. An keep this a guy once told me “I’d rather spend a life being hated for what I am rather that spend a life being accepted for what I am not”, Fixing your flaws when possible etc is good, but what I am trying to say is that loneliness sometimes can be rough and people seem to change themselves only to fit in, don’t ever do that.",6,ToastMe

Watch some make up videos  on YouTube catered to hooded eyes to get your started, it's tricky but you'll really be able to make your eyes look stunning. Other then videos for hooded eyes the best videos are by Korean make up artists, they really take makeup to the next level and do it perfectly. Western makeup is so heavy and thick.

"You are worth so much more than some idiot who would simply up and leave. That is not the kind of person you want in your or your son's life. You have created a beautiful young life and are blessed to have him in your life going forward. His love and your bond, unlike this pain, is forever. Find your strength in him. Reach out to family and friends. You will get through this even if it appears impossible right now.

Hang in there! Much love.",6,ToastMe
"You will push through this because you have to. You will find your strength beyond strength, and when the dust clears, you’ll be on the other side stronger than ever. 

To echo other comments: in spite of the pain I can see in your eyes, I can’t help but imagine you with a smile on your face. I bet you light up rooms when you walk in.  I saw the word “radiate” used twice and my lord, what an appropriate word to describe you. 

Stay strong for yourself , first and foremost. That strength will transfer to your son..Today’s sadness is often tomorrow’s gift of happiness. The path traveled to get there is often difficult yet it’s worth it. 

Find your strength beyond strength and flourish.",6,ToastMe

Mom was always honest what few times I asked about him, but still, two and a half decades later, I hate the bastard to my core. I have no idea how to alleviate the pain you're going through, and I honestly can't say it gets better. However, I can say this:  


1. This is on him. It is \*not\* a reflection of you, or your value as a person. It \*is\* a reflection of his absolute selfishness and heartless nature.  

2. You're not alone. Millions of people like us have had our lives burned by someone who waited until they started a life with someone to run away from it. For what little solace it's worth, we're with you.",6,ToastMe
Single parent for 7 years here. I left him so it’s not quite the same but I will say this: it wasn’t easy but it turned out for the better. If someone doesn’t want to be in you or your sons life as much as it hurts it’s always for the better. It makes room in your life for someone who WANTS to be there AND that is wayyyy better than the pain of the loss to you and your son.,6,ToastMe
"I know this is tough, and it seems like the world is against you. But remember that you'll come out of this stronger and a better person overall for you and your son. Focus on him and you.

So sorry this has happened to you. 
You are not two halves of a whole, you have just shared your company with someone who shared theirs, until they didn't. That doesn't mean you are worthless though, you have a little boy and so much of the world to show him. You are worth all of his time <3

Go and look in the mirror, take a breath, and say 'ill be okay', and any other time you doubt yourself.. go and remind yourself that you can get through this.",6,ToastMe

Same thing happened to me a little over a year ago, had a house together, I had built my life around her, but we weren't great at communicating.

As one of friends keep saying to me 'You do you', take care of your child, live for him and the future with him, but don't forget yourself. Your ex is the one with the problem, for god's sake look at what he's lost. You're fab, you're beautiful and you have got sooooo much more to give. Have your moments, be your best friend, but most of all, love yourself :) x",6,ToastMe

"Recently got out of a 10 year old relationship after I found out my wife was having an affair and no longer wanted to be with me. A day after we broke up we found out she was VERY pregnant and now we are raising our baby girl and our 8 year old son while taking turns. (Yes the baby is mine, thankfully.) It's all very draining mentally.

After 6 months of being alone I'm not at the point where I can say things are ""better"", but the pain is less at least. I still feel very much unwanted, ugly and a garbage human, but there have been days where things suck less and I find myself enjoying the little things again.

Be well, and focus on your friends and family. I isolated myself for a while but that only caused me to spiral downwards. If you're ever lonely and have nobody to reach out to there are plenty of strangers on the internet who know how you feel and would be glad to lend an ear. 

You're never alone, good luck to you and yours.",6,ToastMe
"You will survive and you will persevere. You have a child and you are a person. That means you are not worthless. 

Things will be fine. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow. In short order things will be fine, though. 

You’re confused. Don’t be. The only thing in your life you can control is you. People are logically illogical, so understand the shortcoming wasn’t with you, it was your partner. All you can do is be yourself, understand the fault is not with you (provided you didn’t present divorce papers, cheat, or abuse), and continue living and loving yourself as you are. 

Namaste.",6,ToastMe

"Dude you look so genuinely happy and that shit is contagious!

Congratulations on finding reasons to live and walking yourself into a better life. No one else did that; that's all you! I'm in a similar place; just recently hitting one year sober after I hit my bottom and planned some dark things- I don't have the balls to make a public post like this at all.

I was ready to kill myself, I spent most of my days thinking of what the best time, place and method was, that I could do it quickly and quietly without interruptions. I was about 2 days away from the date I picked before things started to turn around for me. It wasn't the first time I felt suicidal, but it's definitely the closest I've ever gotten to doing it.

Since then so much has happened, and I'm glad I didn't miss it. I'm glad I'm still here, and I'm glad you are too. You seem like a cool dude.",6,ToastMe

For saying, ""I've had enough, I'm drawing the line here because I shouldn't have to go through this alone."" It's hard to do that, especially when you're deep  in the sensations of loss and sadness. I can't imagine losing my husband - I'm so sorry for what you're going through.

"You know and accept yourself more than I do for wearing clothes like that. I think it looks cool, and I bet a lot of people probably give you stares when you go out just because they don't accept it.

Don't forget that it's not just Mr. Rogers that loves and supports you but I do as well, and I know life isn't playing in your favour right now, but things happen in peaks and valleys, and they will get better. Maybe not today, and maybe not tomorrow, but they will get better.",5,ToastMe

"I know that I can't really affect the way that you think of yourself with regards to posting something like this, but I'll still assert that you aren't pathetic for posting this. Oftentimes we can get caught up in things like that, and sometimes it's good to reach out. I felt strangely being kind to people all the time on this subreddit whenever I first came here, but now I've been here for about a year. 

With regards to you attempting to end your life two years ago, I'm glad you are still here and were unsuccessful. I'm certain you create meaning to people around you and people in your life value you. And at the very least, I wanted to take the time out of my day to show you that I value you on some fundamental, else I wouldn't be doing this right now. You are important enough for someone to stop what they're doing and show they care, even if you don't feel that in your immediate physical life. You matter. 

I'm sorry to hear about your mental disorders, and I'm unfortunately not a mental health professional, but I still have hope and faith in you, because you sought us all out. When people seek out help, I see strength in it, in you. At the very least, any time you feel as though it would help you, you can always come to us. I don't ever mean to overstep boundaries when I'm talking about you, because I just want people to feel they're worth it, no matter what their circumstances are in real life. 

You are going to make it and things are going to get better, even though I don't know many of the facts of your life. I do believe in you if no one else does. You will get better.",5,ToastMe

It's people like you who are keeping us afloat in times like these. Especially since you're foregoing being with your family for their safety and due to your job. I'd say give them a call, if possible arrange a face time and just stay in touch with them. It might help eliminate some of the pressure and homesickness for now. 

Aside from that your beard is awesome and your eyes are beautiful, I hope you manage to get some rest and some peace soon.

First off of course congrats on getting out of an abusive relationship secondly I am terribly sorry for your loss. You are a beautiful young woman with a whole life ahead of you and you can always keep the best parts of someone you loved alive in your memories. Someone as lovely as you should not be burdened so young with sadness. Your eyes should sparkle and your cheeks should be flushed with the excitement of youth. You have a face for laughing and lips for smiling and there is hardly a man alive who would not be lucky to catch those dazzling eyes nor a man alive who should not appreciate the curve of your cheek and the wave of your hair.

"Congrats!!! Finally choosing to lose the weight is such a life changing choice, but definitely a good one. 

After being bullied in middle school about weight, I decided to make a change. I started out at 5’7 185 lbs and I’m now 6’1, 170 lbs. on the surface, that doesn’t seem like much, but adjusted for height that is about a 40 lb weight loss. Adjusting for muscle gain, it’s likely I’ve lost even more fat than that. I’m so happy in my skin now. The stretch marks don’t fully go away, but they don’t make me feel bad anymore, they make me feel proud. It’s an amazing feeling when you’ve gotten so used to accidentally looking at your reflection at a pool or something and seeing flab, and expecting the same after losing it all and seeing toned muscle and abs. 

My main advice for you is to find a habit that will help you live a healthy lifestyle and continue to lose and keep the weight off. For me, it was track and field. 

You’ve got this! I’m rooting for you. Please keep us updated!",5,ToastMe

You are so awesome! This is a huge step, and it shows how caring of a person you are! It's amazing when people are willing to change their lives for their children!

I am positive you will be a great mom! You look so happy and proud, as you should be! 

Keep up the good work!",5,ToastMe
"actively pursuing a phd is so so far from stagnating-- you're going after something that most people don't ever achieve in their lifetime. I'm sure the work and stress can be overwhelming, but you do have a realistic and achievable end goal that not only proves your hard work and dedication but will also bear fruit further down the line.

you're not stagnating, you're just playing the long game. keep playing. you've got this.",5,ToastMe
"From someone just starting an engineering degree, you're doing great. You've got a brilliant head on those shoulders, and once you get out of education you'll be more than able to support any endeavor you want to achieve, whether that be starting a family or simply succeeding personally in life.",5,ToastMe
There's not one straight path in life everyone has to take. Making your PhD is awesome!,5,ToastMe
"A year is faster than you think, especially whe. You're focusing on your work, by the time you get that PhD, you won't remember a single detail of the stress you felt working to achieve it, all you'll know is that despite it, you worked through all of it, and got what you wanted. Keep it up, and maybe in 2022, you can start getting more than just a house, you could buy entire apartment buildings and become a landlord, perhaps.",5,ToastMe
"You’re not stagnant. You are actively bettering yourself by pursuing a degree, and you will have achieved something great when you finally get it!",5,ToastMe
"I do not know you but I am so freaking proud of you! Getting a PhD is a HUGE endeavor. You are sacrificing time, relationships, MONEY, and so much more to reach your goals. The independence and free time you will experience after completing your PhD will be so worth it! You are setting yourself and your future family up for a successful life. 

You are excelling not stagnating! You are in the last lap and you got this, you always did!",5,ToastMe
"Really happy for you op, keep it up!!",5,ToastMe
Good luck brother,5,ToastMe
I'm glad you're not on the cocaine man. Drugs are hard. I haven't ever struggled with street drugs as much but I had an issue with alcohol back when I was a big younger. (I still use a nickname I was given back then as a username kind of ironicly) Addiction is such a taxing thing to deal with. I'm proud of you and you sure as hell should be too! Keep chugging along my friend.,5,ToastMe
It takes a strong willed bloke to make it 7 months clean. Already done more then most. Stay in there 👊,5,ToastMe
"Hey man, that's fricking amazing! Glad to hear that you got clean and I am very proud of you, it sounds like you properly worked on yourself :)  You seem like a great and caring dad! It isn't easy and I have faith that you will be able to keep this up - you're a rockstar",5,ToastMe
"Edit: I though this was roast me and just wrote something real mean, thankfully realised and deleted. Good work proud of you.",5,ToastMe
"You're doing great!! Personally I've been in an endless cycle of using, getting clean for a month or two, and then relapsing. Ive actually had some very kind words from redditors today after I opened up about relapsing very recently, and they've helped me find the willpower to try again. 36 is a lot of days for something like this, and I'm gonna do my best to follow in your footsteps, so don't give up! I'm counting on you! We could even make it a competition if that helps 😁😂

But seriously. Meth and heroin are the worst of the worst. They are the guys that will fuck up your life and still keep you coming back. Drugs are a temporary relief, and the physical and mental aftermath, especially after being clean for a while, is SO not worth it. You are doing the absolute STRONGEST thing you could possibly do right now,  fighting against all of the odds,  like a superhero in the final battle of an action movie.  But the good guys beat the bad guys,  and get the happy ending.  You're gonna get the happy ending!  The entire audience (metaphorically speaking) is rooting for you! And the hero is allowed t u have setbacks; it means the hero is developed as a character, and the end is so much more gratifying when they do finally defeat the evil. 

Drugs are the villain  and a very smart villain too. But you're the hero. You  CAN win. Ever yuine is rooting for you, standing behind you, and cheering you on, wanting you to succeed. And if you lose a battle, it's not the end. You just get back up and try again. 

Never give up. There is a light at the end of the tunnel. And when you reach it, you'll wonder why you ever considered turning back.


If you ever want to message me, feel free to do so. Sometimes talking to someone who understands what you are going through can make all the difference.",5,ToastMe
"That’s quite an achievement.  You did the right thing. Everyone is proud of you. Those two drugs are horrendous to kick, but together? You brave, brave woman. You got this.",5,ToastMe
"Holy shit that's awesome! You look great, especially considering you just got off heroin and fucking M E T H. 

Keep at it, yo. I'm a Marylander, and we have a huge opioid epidemic. I've know people who've overdosed. One of my friends uncles overdosed in their bathroom. Not good stuff at all. It's really fucking shit to see people die from that. 

Don't be another statistic. And I mean that in the nicest way possible.",5,ToastMe
You're doing an amazing job!,5,ToastMe

"I feel for you. Rejection from someone you care so much for is one of the hardest things to deal with. Good on you for knowing your worth and leaving though. It hurts a lot now, but in the long run you'll likely be much better off. Hang in there.",5,ToastMe
You deserve someone that is devoted to you and loves you as deeply as you love them. It’s gut wrenching now but it will stop. I went for a year like that until I met my husband. It just sort of ebbs and fades after you find someone or something really worth it. I don’t even know why I was so upset about the person things didn’t work out with.. What I thought we had pales in comparison to the love I have with my husband. I just didn’t know it yet. I hope you find yourself and whatever or whoever you are looking for 💕,5,ToastMe
"They may not have loved and valued you, but you did the hugely difficult and painful albeit right thing: you proved that you loved yourself. THAT is the most important thing to take from all of this. When the hurt passes (and it most assuredly will), you’re going to feel so freaking amazing being good to yourself. I’m so proud of you!",5,ToastMe
Needless to say we are all super impressed! You did it now you just have to keep it up! Cheers my friend!,5,ToastMe

"I hope this makes sense but too many men would’ve taken those situations and used them as an excuse to be a douche bag. You were clearly raised to approach the world with kindness; your brave soul shines through in this time and it’s so admirable and attractive. Things will get better for you eventually, I promise, and your positivity will make you even stronger than before. I hope you have a great day, and just for the record I think you’re very cute :) when I saw your picture I smiled. And your story broke my heart!

"Fellow teen with autism here, remember that your autism can be your super power but also your worst enemy of you let it get that way. 

I also deal with severe anxiety, depression comes and goes. It’ll get better though, I recently lost a 13 year old cousin to the flu, it can only get better! You will think there’s no way that it will get better, there’s no way that it will not get better! Loss is one of the hardest things, combine that with depression, anxiety and sometimes autism and it can become dangerous. Just hang in there though, just remember that it can only get better.",5,ToastMe

You can have as much as much of a family as you want, all on your on timeline. If you don't find anyone and still want kids? Adopt! Big messy families are awesome.

I just went to mine yesterday because I started a new job at the beginning of this month, but don't get paid until next week. They're really helpful and it's likely that all you need is your ID and maybe proof of address.

You’re my hero today. x",5,ToastMe
"Look man I'll be honest. This is a very unflattering angle for you. Looked at your post history and saw your twitch stream. Listen to me you have the ability to be super attractive, for real. If I were you, I'd change the hair, probably get a haircut and start working out a bit. I can see that you have great skin, great facial structure, with minimal amount of work you can completely transform your looks and self-esteem.

"This is more of a rant toast, but hear me out here:

My ex-husband requested an open marriage when I was pregnant with our son. I said no, fast forward he checked out of the relationship, questionable things happened, he wanted a divorce, I left with our newborn to live with my sister. 

Fast forward some years - ex husband and I are now divorced, I'm re-married and SO happy with my current husband. Ex husband still a lousy dad, suicidal because his live-in girlfriend cheated on him with multiple guys. 

You would think he would have the ability to think critically about this, and realize that, wow, I had done similar things to my ex-wife. Now I understand why she was so upset. I shouldn't be with someone like this.

Nope, he leaves her for less than 24 hours, then gets back together with her. Even though her actions caused him to be suicidal. 

I'm glad you have the self-worth to get the hell out of that kind of relationship. You will find someone else that will be a much better fit, and will love you solely and unconditionally. I'm sorry about what you're going through. It's really hard. But you will get through it! Take care of yourself and do what you need to do to grieve and move on. Better days will come, I promise!",5,ToastMe
"You got this bro. Been fucked over way to many times and almost gave up on trying to be a nice guy all around. Glad I didn’t because my current girlfriend is amazing and I just wanted to make sure you don’t let her actions determine your future with other women. Eventually you’ll find someone that deserves you, because clearly your ex didn’t. Stay strong, King. Keep your chin up. Don’t let this define you. 🤘",5,ToastMe
"I'm sorry to hear what happened. Fuck cheaters.
You don't need her, you got this, man! I know you're hurting a lot right now but it'll get better. You'll find a better woman someday.

"Your son still loves you unconditionally and will always be your son and in your life if you choose, so focus on the positive in this otherwise awful situation. You have the option of the best revenge, living well. Have a kickass time with your son! Internet hugs from Canada!",5,ToastMe
"Remember that you are not the reason.

I am sure ""The person who you built your life with"" had a reason or reasons, but please do not blame yourself. I have some experience with these kinds of things from both sides of the equation. Sometimes the party that is leaving doesn't want to leave, but feels there is no other way to maintain (or regain) their sanity except to leave.

My former boss's husband kicked her out of the house they both bade payments on and would only respond to anything she said by singing Michael Jackson's ""beat it"". Despite all his friends telling him he was being an idiot, he pushed her away hard as he was overwhelmed and stressed beyond the breaking point.

It took a lot of effort and penitence on my employer's part to let him get back to a stable point. After he became stable again, he was too embarrassed by his actions to try and salvage their relationship (that and he was the type who never apologized).

The reason I bring this up, is because the hubby of this story didn't want to hurt his wife emotionally (and didn't physically, mind you), but he was at a point where he needed to fight or flee. Given those being the only alternatives in his mind, it was for the best that he fled vs fought.

If you want my advise for your current situation based on my experience, I would say to give ""The person who you built your life with"" some time and space. If you would have them back still, make that clear and just leave the metaphorical door open for them to return.",5,ToastMe
"I know that the situation seems the most complicated right now. I'm 19 and have no experience with a situation even remotely similar to this, but my suggestion would be to take a few days out of your time to think about what just happened, process it completely, even write it on paper if that helps (it does for me), and then, when it's totally sunk in, then figure out what to do. You could also write that down. Like bullet points, or something. The point is, you need to know what to do, but you're confused, so you gotta wait for your head to get cleared, and then make decisions. Decisions that aren't entirely based on the negative emotions and hurt mindset you're experiencing right now. 
I'm sure you can get through this. But you have to give yourself time first, and then respond to the situation accordingly, in an appropriate way.",5,ToastMe
"Girl, I know it’s difficult, especially with a precious little nugget. Just love on your son, give him your whole heart and he will turn out alright. I was the baby my dad left. My mom worked her ass off to give me what she could. It wasn’t much given the situation she was in, but he WILL be grateful for you. He may not realize it until he is much older. Sometimes it takes until they are doing life on their own to understand what you went through to be where you are. You will do amazing! You’re gorgeous and just take your time to grieve and move on. Love yourself. Don’t fret over the loss. You will be a great mom! ☺️",5,ToastMe

"Ignorance is bliss, some people might argue ignorance is suffering, and it will be in the long run, but in your case, it really is bliss.   
He left you and your son for no deducable reason, but it's you having the audacity to feel ""worthless"" because you are self-conscious enough to feel so, while he has no problem simply... bouncing, because he is, I safely assume, pretty ignorant.  


You feel ""worthless"" because the kind of person who's liable to abandon his loved ones and child ""randomly"" just left you. You're giving too much credence to the wrong feedback from the wrong direction.   
It's like if you looked in a cracked, dusty mirror and criticized your reflection in it.   


It's understandable that you feel confused, who wouldn't. Instead, take what this situation can potentially teach you, related to future relationships: Do not build your life ""with"" someone. Build your life yourself and decide who you want to enter.",5,ToastMe

"You are a wise, wonderful, warm person who has a lot to offer. you built a life with that person and now have a chance to build a better life with your child and yourself, and then with someone else, more deserving of the two of you. and the lives you build will ebb and flow, and you will always be at the centre, loving and kind, beautiful and vulnerable, and always making the best world and life for those around you.",5,ToastMe

When you’re having to focus on a toxic relationship it takes away from your kids. Because your mind is always caught up with the heartbreak. You don’t miss this person, you missed the idea of who this person could’ve been. But, that’s not who they are and we can’t get into relationships to change people. You really dodged a bullet if you think about it. Your little one is little. He probably won’t remember this heartbreak and you’ll go on and find somebody that loves every single bit of you and cherishes you on a daily basis. That’s what your little man needs.. a good example and this wasn’t it!  
Your beautiful and you have a long life ahead of you!!",5,ToastMe

"First of all after reading this post, can I just say how lucky your kids are to have you? I know no situation is black & white but you’re going through so much right now & all you wanted was some time with your kids. So many people are not this way. You’re a strong man, and this journey will just make you stronger. You deserve someone who genuinely loves you & picks you first & clearly your ex isn’t the one. You’ll have more chances to be there for your children, for now you have to focus on getting better so you can be back in the dad action! I know it’s easier said than done but keep your head up, don’t worry about what you’re ex is doing with her boss, this time is about healing & learning about how to be you without an us. Continue being a great man & father & the right woman will want to be apart of that, I’m sorry she didn’t. I hope you all the best, get well, and have a great time next time you see your children!",4,ToastMe

As soon as she started to overdose they left her there. They didn't call an ambulance nothing. Her body was found 3 days later. Her death destroyed me. She was my best friend. A big part of me died with her. I'm so glad your boys saved you. Because they would have been thru what i went thru. It would have destroyed them. I am so proud of you.

I dont usually say much on these posts, but youre beautiful. Absolutely lovely. And please don't take it out on yourself for the bad judgement some men have made towards you. The defect is definitely THEIRS. The way you were treated has NOTHING to do with you, but exposes their own damaged personalities. You were just a convenient person to unload THEIR inner pain on.

It would be easy for me to sit here and give you all kinds of free advice. But at the end of the day, I've found that you have to love yourself. People can be spiteful and mean. Try not to let them drag you down. Easier said than done yes...but you have to work on it.

It's not always whats on the outside that counts, although I would say you're stunning regardless. The person that was nasty to you is a lowlife scum.

You undoubtably have/will come across tragedy during these times but keep this in mind, all you can do is try your best with what you've got. Resources and staff are limited globally and there is little that us healthcare workers can do about it on a larger scale.

To clarify, a lot of people are asking how I can be teaching at this level with only a Bachelor’s degree... I will be teaching custodial courses to mentally ill prisoners. Yes, a prison. 

All of my students will have had to complete their GED program and will need skills to learn how to get a job when they’re released. One day in my class takes a half-day off their sentences. They’re choosing to take my courses rather than being forced to be there.

I’ve already taught a few of them during my interview process. I was expecting to be received with lots of cat calling and and trash talk. But I was pleasantly surprised. I’d actually rather teach these guys than the general population. 

The best part about all of this is that I will be able to help people who want to help themselves. So, my struggles and their struggles are similarly parallel. It’s full circle.

Listen, in an academic setting, you get a really skewed version of the world. It quickly becomes standard to be surrounded by people with higher or more apparently difficult degrees, and all those /real life/ things like getting married and starting families seems all the more precious.

But what you're doing? Where you are in your life? It's fantastic. You are FANTASTIC, strong, and brilliant. Keep in mind that this is special and rare, and that all of those other /real life/ things will come on their own time.

For now, keep it up. You've done so well to get here; I know you can handle everything that comes next.",4,ToastMe

Also, most of my friends that got a degree/job earlier than me are also unhappy due to running after the prestigiousness/high paying job rather than what they genuinely enjoy. Makes me feel really good that I decided to do things at my own pace with no comparisons!

"So, the honest and probably hard truth is that everything will continue to remind you of him, but let it remind you that you are strong enough to be without him. Your heart will repair stronger than before, and you will understand that you are the only person you really need.

"I was once in the same position as you and I know how hard it is. I know everything hurts right now but it really does get better over time. Just remember that he wasn't really the one for you if he wasn't madly in love with you too! You deserve someone who will be head over heels for you and shares a mutual love 🥰

When I broke up with my ex I was really fucked up and sad but after a few weeks I realized it wasn't the type of love I wanted nor was it really love on his end. As soon as I accepted that and made a promise that I wouldn't date till I met ""the one"", I met my soulmate a month later and we've been together ever since!!

It will be unnatural to talk to yiurself out loud but believe med,  its the best way to retrain your mind and how you feel about yourself and if yiu do this 3x each day for a week, I gurantee the feelings you are experiencing now about being stood up, will diminish",4,ToastMe
"I'm not eloquent so accept my apologies in advance. 

First off, great job reaching out. It sounds so simple but you (and I) know it can seem almost impossible when one is depressed. 

Secondly, please make an appointment with your doctor. It can be very effective to work at this from different angles; time with a close friend, a walk in a park, make a list of good things in your life (even if all you can write at first is a single thing), and try (please) try some medication as prescribed by your doctor. This last step might let you feel ""normal"" or at least stable for a while so you can work on other aspects.

"I'm so sorry you're going through this.  I, too, built my life around my ex (pending divorce) for over 13 years.  That didn't stop her from cheating a few months ago.

It'll be rough goings for a while, to be honest.  Right now, you're probably wanting to do something rash, or seek out answers you will liklely not find/be satisfied with.  Those things will prolong your attempts at a swift recovery, because as the victim of abandonment, we seek clarity when there is already enough clarity for us to accept.  Digging for answers won't net us the closure we think we need.  Closure comes from within you.  You'll never be 100% satisfied with what you find out because of our controlling nature.  And because at this very moment, you're spiraling out of control, your instincts are telling you to take control of the situation.  YOU CAN NOT AND WILL NOT BE ABLE TO.

BUT... What little control you do have right now are things you can easily manage.  Take care to focus on those things, for example, yourself and your son.  Start making plans for what needs to get done, and for things you'd like to get accomplished... Then attack those goals relentlessly until you've got some wins under your belt.  These things can be as simple as taking up new hobbies, exercising more, spending more time with your son, getting a job (if you don't already have one), seeking local support, making new friends, or even errands/chores that have been piling up.  Distract yourself with productive actions, rather than unproductive ones where nothing gets achieved.

I don't wanna go on too long, but if you'd like to talk more, feel free to message me.  I, myself, am still recovering... but each day gets a little bit better if you allow it to.  Take good care of yourself.  You are still loved, acknowledged, and appreciated by many... even strangers from Reddit.  Recognize that THAT is just as important as the one person you thought made you feel validated.  Hang in there!",4,ToastMe

"How can someone as sacrificing and giving as you feel worthless? You've built your life with a wrong person, but that doesn't mean you can't still use what you've shed sweat and tears for. You have a two year old to look after and shower your endless love with. You have something pure left that many aren't blessed with. But that sob fact aside, a loving mother is never useless. A good person is never useless. 

Stay strong. Both for yourself and your son. You deserve all the love, happiness, strength and joy life can give, and therefore, i wish it all for you and your child.",4,ToastMe

And it is ok to cry!! It really is. There is no shame in it, if this if something that makes you feel better just cry. But also remember to keep your head up, breathe in and just go on with your life. Even though he will not be in it anymore, that was his choice.

"Hey OP.  Just want to say I know the pain in your eyes.  That's the same pain I saw in my wife's eyes when I first met her right after she left her first husband and took their 2 year old with her.

There's a good chance you're gonna put up wall after wall for awhile, and that's ok!  The most important thing is to never lose yourself.  Lean on your support group as much as you need to.  Let them be your light if you ever find yourself in a dark place.  Eventually you will find your way out and emerge so much stronger than you ever thought you could be.

Other than yourself, the only other person you need to be concerned with is your son.  There WILL come the time when he will start asking questions (if he hasn't already).  Be factual, and don't be afraid to tell him you don't know the answer.  Kids understand more than most people realize.  Try your best to steer his attention to the positive things and shower him with love.  And DON'T badmouth his father in front of him.  Let him learn on his own and come to his own conclusions about his father.

If and when the time comes for you to start dating again, YOU set the pace.  If you start getting close to someone and get cold feet, speak up!  Any person worth a damn will understand.  It took 5 years and dating twice before my relationship with my wife ""stuck"".

The main part of healing from this is time.  Nothing is going to happen overnight.  But one day you will wake up and realize that you don't need the walls anymore, and you'll smile the beautiful smile that we all know you possess.",4,ToastMe

Try to take care of yourself during this time, back to basics of water, hygiene and sleep.

In the second one your stomach is covered, and your face is the focus. it says ""Look how happy I am!"" I feel the second one lacks the questioning nature of the first, and instead is a statement.

And honestly, who needs a college degree when you’re already a fashion expert? You look absolutely stunning and amazing, everyone’s been telling you this but it’s true. If I had the money I’d definitely ask if you do fashion advice hahah 

Can’t really help you with friends, but if you want to talk online, my inbox is always open! I know it’s not the same but you know, with adult life being so busy, I mostly talk with my local friends online too, so that’s not on you!

It's been six months here now, and I'd be lying to you if I said I was happy. Or even over her. But I'm better. And day by day it gets a tiny bit better, until one day it goes away altogether. 

You just have to hang in there, my man. Sending you all the love I can from over here in Denmark. Stay strong.",3,ToastMe
"When I see your face, I see no pathetic man. 
Stay strong.",3,ToastMe
"I am so sorry you are going through such a traumatic time :( I truly believe life will get easier and better on the other side of your divorce and recovery. 
And on the bright side you are VERY handsome and seem very smart and kind, and one day when you are ready will have no problem finding a new love!",3,ToastMe
"I’m so sorry for all that you are going through right now, and I don’t think I can offer any words of sympathy or encouragement that other fine redditors haven’t already offered more elegantly than I. 

But may I just say that for someone going through all that, and in the hospital, your hair looks amazing. Like, full on comic book hair swoop. 

I see a man with hair like that, I know he is prepared to handle ANYTHING.",3,ToastMe

"I literally cried reading this and seeing all these supportive comments. I've also been going through some traumatic stuff with my significant other. He cheated numerous times and pretty much broke up with me the other night for getting upset about him going out to drink with his female coworker at her place, and I felt pathetic begging him to take it back and stay with me. I am still with him and spending every day dealing with incredible anxiety about what to do and what the future holds, and horrible depression. I dont have much to give right now, because I'm also in a really bad head space, but please know my thoughts and prayers are with you, and that things will get better. Stay strong bud. We can do this, one day at a time.",3,ToastMe
"Hey, dude. I'm sorry all of that happened to you. That is really really terrible. I hope things start to look up for you. I'm glad you got through your surgery and you'll be able to have other visits with your children. I'm going through a divorce myself and a lot of people have told me that it gets easier. So here's to hoping! I know everything does though. I wish you good luck and a quick recovery. Also your ex wife sucks and I hope that every time she gets a piece of fruit its over ripe.",3,ToastMe

Oh look at that. I spot a great parent. They spawn very rarely.,3,ToastMe
I put the bottle down just a little over 3 years ago and it’s been the best choice of my life. My two kids were still young and didn’t fully understand the problem I had. I tried hard to never drink in front of them and I didn’t but one day my wife and boys came home and I was completely passed out on the couch. I woke up at 3am and never felt like a bigger pile of shit in my life. Needless to say the wife pretty much gave me “the 2 roads” and I haven’t touched a drop of booze since then. We all gotta find our reason to drop an addiction and I’m glad you found yours. It’s a tough road but with good people around you it’s very very possible. Worst part is my mother died when I was 24 from alcoholism and my father would be absent stretches at a time cause of his alcoholism and as a kid you see that and say “not me I won’t be that” but you wake up one day at 5 in the afternoon and realize...welp guess I became them. Best of luck to you man stick around for your kids they need you more than you need any substance and you can do it!,3,ToastMe
"Hey friend, you got this, I dont know you but you've overcome so much. You can PM me whenever you're feeling down or lonely. It takes a lot of strength to leave an abusive relationship so I know you're strong and I know you can make it through this.",3,ToastMe
"You have incredibly kind eyes.  Eyes that have seen a lot, more than you should have.  But they also have a twinkle to them that shows your strength.  Your smile tells me that you've been through hell, but you're out of hell.  You're moving forward and will keep going forward.

You've got this...more than you know!

&#x200B;

P.S. My best friend of 29 years took her life as well.  I found her.  I can tell you from experience that it will be ok.  It never really goes away, but now I remember all the amazing memories.  You'll get there.",3,ToastMe
"You are absolutely gorgeous and your hair is amazing. I feel like ghosting is such a common occurrence in the dating world now, even though it sucks don’t let it get you down. It’s clearly their loss!  I know how you feel, I’ve been pretty lonely myself lately. One of my goals for 2020 is to find a few local groups specific to things I’m interested in and force myself out of my comfort zone to make some new friends. It’s so easy in today’s world to shut yourself off from society- I hope you can find the energy to also put yourself out there! You’ve already taken the biggest step in leaving abuse so even though it may not feel like it, the worst is over and new beginnings await. A toast to you, lovely lady!

Edit: you should definitely join the indiemakeupandmore sub if you haven’t already. Wonderful, wonderful group of people over there and I noticed you have your own indie brand!",3,ToastMe

Eat right, and enjoy the time you have with yourself, things WILL get better and you deserve as much.",3,ToastMe

Please keep your smile safe.",3,ToastMe

"I'm a therapist (art therapy & counseling). Some people suggested therapy, so here's my take in case you wanna consider it. There are free and affordable therapies. In case you are really interested in a specific therapist, ask them - or look for - a ""sliding scale,"" which is basically negotiating prices-per-session. There are many therapists and over 1000+ psychotherapeutic approaches. If at any point during treatment you don't click with the therapist or you don't find them helping you, ADDRESS it with them! Tell them exactly how you feel and why you think this is not working. It is a therapist's ethical obligation to listen to your needs because a therapist is there FOR YOU and YOU are the one that's important. If it doesn't work out it is also their ethical obligation to refer you to someone with whom you might benefit from.
Support groups are ok, but if there is not a group therapist present it might be risky.
I'm wondering, have you tried exercises to change your thought patterns? Like, recognizing the negative things you say about yourself and changing them (there's more to it than that but I'm trying to be brief)?
Ghosting is actually more normal than you think. I don't know the exact number, but regardless how you look, you are 3 times more likely to get ghosted at any given point by an online match than getting a reply. Trust me, as a guy, ghosting has become kind of an expected thing from an online match. I got ghosted once 1 hour before a date with a simple ""Sorry, something came up."" I've asked if they wanna reschedule and got no answer. That was a year ago.
Look, people can tell you that you look gorgeous every day, but if you don't believe it it's like going through one ear and exiting through another. And if you don't believe that you are beautiful, that's completely ok and there's no shame in feeling the way you feel. Because no one knows what it's like to be you and what it's like being in your skin. You are always doing your best considering your life circumstances. The feelings that you have are real because you feel them, because they are real to you, but the REALITY surrounding those feelings may not be.
Now, I said I won't comment on your appearance, but your smile is the purest thing I've seen this whole week, so there :)",3,ToastMe

"Even your sad smile is beautiful. You’ve been so brave to leave an abusive relationship. It’s going to take a little while to find yourself again but you’ll get there. You’ve already done the hardest part. 

Don’t feel lonely: there are hundreds of people who need comfort just like you do right now. Some of them are reading your post and reaching out to you in their hearts. You have a whole family of survivors ready to welcome you - you just haven’t found them yet.",3,ToastMe

My daughter has alopecia. She lost hair and then it grew back but any event could trigger the loss again. Your hair does not define you and you are incredibly beautiful. Even if you were to lose all of your hair it would not change that fact. I also know someone with alopecia universalis and does not grow hair anywhere. She is beautiful and I had no clue that she struggled with that until I opened up about my daughter's alopecia. Feel good about yourself. You are beautiful and you are not alone.,3,ToastMe
"Wow. You’re honestly stunning! And I love how you filled in your eyebrows (if you did :) either way, very nice!) I wish I did mine that great. 

But honestly, you’re really beautiful with great skin and you have pretty eyes too. Your face is such a “distraction” for the hair. You can’t even tell it’s thinning from the first pic.",3,ToastMe

You're so adorable and omg that shirt made my day. I can't believe so many people have to point out things we already know about ourselves and probably are an insecurity to us. Like what is the point? They're not helping and their comment could really ruin someone's day. I hope you know you're very pretty and I can tell through your kindness in the comments that you're a good person. We need more people like you in the world. Keep being positive :),3,ToastMe

"You are projecting an amazingly beautiful and positive energy.  Just know that whoever commented negatively is probably living a life of internal misery.  I encourage you to develop and maintain hobbies that you are passionate about and surround yourself with the people you meet in those shared pursuits.

I think you look beautiful and I love your hair especially the style! I love your shirt too its cute and cool 😊 I think you look amazing and kind and if anyone thinks otherwise then they're wrong likely just insecure about themselves! I hope you have a good day and take care of yourself 😊,3,ToastMe

"An old friend (21F) of mine had alopecia and was very insecure about it. People were making comments to the point where she started wearing a beanie to school every day, but then people got mean and started ripping her beanie off when she wasn’t paying attention. She ended up shaving her head, and about 4 years later it’s grown back fuller than ever. I’m honestly jealous of her hair now. I (23F) also struggle with thinning hair, but only on the sides of my head at the roots, so it’s only noticeable if I pull my hair into a pony/bun. 


Anyway, you’re absolutely beautiful and you have one of the sweetest faces I’ve ever seen. You’re so incredibly strong, and it really shows. I hope you have a lovely rest of your day, and bask in all these compliments. You very well deserve each and every one, and then some. Keep your chin up, people who are rude about minuscule things such as appearance and things that are out of your control aren’t worth your time of day. Kill ‘em with kindness, and proceed with loving yourself. Love that you have the capability of being sweet and confident. Too many people turn sour, because of things they can’t change. You’re one of the bright ones 😉 Don’t ever lose that smile of yours.

Cheers, doll.",3,ToastMe

"Oh man, hair? Who needs it? How about courage? How about self respect? How about empathy for others, and an open heart? When you got those things, there's nothing on Earth that can compete with you. Especially some dead cells that we call ""hair."" That shit is weak, and you are STRONG! Those dummies who can't tell which is more important, I guarantee they will look back and fall into themselves with remorse and shame at how they treated you. It's not fair it had to be you, but you have given them a lesson in humanity and humility. All just by being your beautiful self. 💙",3,ToastMe

"Listen, you have had a very unique life story so far. Yes, it has been a bad story so far but it is up to you and no one else how it will turn out. You can use these things to motivate you or you can use them to destroy you. What would your girlfriend wanted you to become? What do you enjoy? World is a wonderful and horrible place, time for you to see the wonderful part of it.",3,ToastMe
"I'm so proud of you! First you know in your heart that death is not the only solution, otherwise you wouldn't have posted here. And second, you are so incredibly strong. You are doing an awesome job taking care of yourself, going to the hospital, to therapy and posting here because you realized you needed it. Keep up the good work. You are worth it, we know it and you know it!",3,ToastMe
"That is a lot for one person to go through. If it helps, keep in mind that you feel awful because of the things that have happened to you, not because you are a defective person. This is how you feel now but it won't always feel the same. I hope your pain eases and you find your true friends and family. Sending virtual hugs.",3,ToastMe
-hugs- if you want them from an internet stranger. I’m sorry you had to go through so much shit but you know it’s not how you leap it’s how you land. It doesn’t look like it now but I do believe you can get better. Don’t give up. You just need a plan and throw yourself at it with all you got. What helped me out of my worst phases was my dog.  She forced me to go out and keep her busy. Maybe you can volunteer at a shelter?  It won’t solve your problems but it could help you get over the worst things. Also be kind to yourself - eat as well as you can afford and don’t give up on yourself. Even if you improve at a snails pace you’re still getting better.,3,ToastMe
"You've been through so much. Your story has really touched me. You're worth so much more than what life has offered you so far. I just want to give you a hug honestly. I have a similar background and I just want to ask you, to please not give up. I refuse to give up too, although sometimes I've wanted to. I want to see people like us keep going. Please keep going. X",3,ToastMe
"Your current situation should not define you. You seem like a genuinely nice guy who has had a lot of shit things thrown your way. But segway ugh your skin is fucking amazing my dude, as a Dudette I'm envious.  And your eyes, even though you have experienced much pain they are still so kind looking.",3,ToastMe
"Oh man you look so cute and deserves to be taken care of! You should give someone that opportunity, doesn't matter if its a pet, kids, wife or anything
You just deserve to be happy and loved",3,ToastMe
"As someone who has had post pregnancy complications that put my life in serious danger, I want you to know that never for a second did your mother think that you should be blamed for her death. She loved you more than anything and you were her pride and joy. She would do anything in her power to protect you from that thought. And she would have given anything to stay with you on earth because you are her world. It is not your fault and she would not want you to give up",3,ToastMe
"Keep ya head up, mate.

And to live is to suffer. To survive is to find some meaning in your suffering. Find your meaning.",3,ToastMe
"My Friend, death is not a solution. 
You’ve been hit long enough that you don’t know your true strength. Look inside, look around and rise up to create what you never had. Create what you need. Create what others need. 
You will be better. Your are better.",3,ToastMe
Everyone passes through difficult moments in their lives and I'm sorry to stress that out but your story is indeed very sad. You being here can be a great help to others that also have been through a lot and you will do comprehend them for sure. Better times will come and you will be fine for sure. Stay strong.,3,ToastMe
"You look like a kind and genuine person. Who is quiet in the beginning but after you've opened up and trust people, you are amazing and fun to be with. I know that you haven't been dealt with good cards in your life but dont let it define you! There is so much to life, it's not always going to be bad. You're a good looking man and I'm sure you're going to meet someone new who's going to make you fall in love again but for the time being, work on yourself. Set and achieve goals. It will get better 🤗",3,ToastMe
"You have very kind eyes and a great smile. 

I'm sorry your life up to this point has been awful, BUT, this random stranger totally believes in you. Life is a struggle, but I believe you're strong enough to rally. Don't let those other fuckers win.

"It's not your fault. None of this is. You may want to blame yourself for all of this and even more, but I can tell you that it isn't your fault.

Keep fighting for your mental health, because with a lot of work and especially a lot perseverance, you can get out of this and become the great, healthy person you were destined to be. Whatever you do, don't stop fighting

The biggest part about this to me is that you’re still here. Those are some truly awful things to live through and the fact that you have the courage to still fight everyday? That’s inspiring man. You inspired me as soon as I read this to be able to deal with the things in my life right now. You really are a strong and courageous fellow.,3,ToastMe
You got this!,3,ToastMe
That's awesome! Seriously. I really admire discipline like that. I wish I had it. :). You're doing great!,3,ToastMe

You’re awesome. Learn some business too and you GOT THIS! You look smart. :),3,ToastMe
"Dude, you have one life, do what you love!!!!!!",3,ToastMe
Before I even read your post I was thinking “what a great mug”. You made that! That’s so awesome! Practical degrees are overrated. You made the right choice.,3,ToastMe
Love the craftsmanship! Way to follow your dreams and accomplishing something amazing! Keep up the amazing work and I look forward to seeing more of your art,3,ToastMe
"If it is something you love and are passionate about, make it practical.",3,ToastMe
"THAT MUG IS SO GOOD! You've made a great choice. I'm not even kidding or exaggerating, if someone actually gave me something like that I'd love it😍.",3,ToastMe
"It took me a long time to convince my wife that she was making the right choice to pursue a career in ceramics. I totally understand the self doubt because I’ve seen it first hand.  Just keep at it and know that it’s going to come with a lot of ups and downs....a cost well worth it in pursuing what you love. Please keep going and try your best not to let these doubts sidetrack you. You are definitely doing the right thing, don’t let anyone make you feel otherwise!!",3,ToastMe
"Imma need a link for a website or something so I can buy one of your pieces, because that’s a gorgeous mug.",3,ToastMe
"That’s a beautiful mug, and people buy that sort of thing so your degree is practical! Plus a world without art wouldn’t be worth living in",3,ToastMe
"Here’s the thing, it’s your education, you’re gonna be paying for it possibly for years to come. Why not make it valuable! 

I am nearly 50 years old and went to college right outta school. Do you know what I learned? Me neither. But I paid for it for about 10 years. If I had studied something I loved, I could have at least been glad of what I learned while I paid for learning it. 

Even if you don’t have a career later where a degree in Ceramics would be useful, the knowledge and enjoyment you get from studying it has value all of its own.",3,ToastMe
Cool mug it’s like something out of lotr or something,3,ToastMe
You have talent!  I love your hair.,3,ToastMe
"Yo that mug is nice, where can I buy some of your pottery and ceramics?",3,ToastMe
"You honestly look like you’re glowing. I wish I could’ve picked something I loved. I still don’t know what I want to do. I know you say you’re feeling shitty but you look so happy. That mug is beautiful, I wish I could make something half as pretty as that!!! Don’t doubt yourself, if you love this... keep doing what you do. You could sell on Etsy or something like that at the very least and people can live decent lives off of selling stuff like this. I think it is practical... keep doing what you’re doing.",3,ToastMe
Work at it with the same conviction as you would something “practical” and it will become something you love and something practical.,3,ToastMe
"I did the opposite of what you did. The people who chose the artistic careers are living really fulfilling lives even if they aren't well-paid...people like me who made the 'smart' choice are in dead-end jobs and depressed :)

But seriously though, that mug is awesome!!",3,ToastMe
"You have a gift. The glaze and shape of the mug go beautifully together. I took ceramics all through high school and wanted to make it a big part of my life, but was not allowed to pursue it. Be bold and immerse yourself in your art form. You can go places!",3,ToastMe
"Gurl, yes. Open a store on etsy, make all the money. You're doing wonderfully.",3,ToastMe
"What our culture tells us is valuable and what is actually valuable are often two different things. 

There are people who changed the world by putting color on fabric. There are people who had the crazy notion that man could fly, which had never happened in thousands of years, and now many people make their livings doing just that. 

The money doesn’t rush in at the beginning when you are taking a new path, but doing what is right by your talents and vision will always elevate you and those who follow. If you spend your time worried about how to make money like the others, you will waste the time you have to make money in your own way. 

The world always needs creatives, but we especially need them when our governments and economies tell us we are just machines and need authoritarian command. We need you and your heart now as much as ever. 

So chin up, keep going.",3,ToastMe
"You know what? I’m jealous of you, because you had the guts to do what you like (maybe ignoring things people said, I don’t know if that’s the case and that’s why you’re doubting about it).
Congrats! I’m really proud of you.",3,ToastMe
Holy moly that’s beautiful! You are incredibly talented and choosing something practical would have been a waste to the world,3,ToastMe
That mug is super pretty! I’d totally buy it,3,ToastMe
"Always love waterfall brown!

Well you've got a super cute face and a mug that I'd totally buy so keep it up 🙂,3,ToastMe
Do what you love!!!,3,ToastMe
The mug looks awesome! I think you made the right choice.,3,ToastMe
Do you sell them? I’m looking for a gift for a friend and this looks like something she’d like!,3,ToastMe
"I took a ceramics class and although I struggled a lot in it, I loved the artistry behind it. It’s incredible what people can do with some clay, a wheel, and their hands. Art is something that stands the test of time and creates life and beauty in this world. Your mug is beautiful and I’m so proud you chose to pursue your passion.",3,ToastMe
Before I read the title my first thought was about how cool that mug is! I love hand made ceramic stuff :),3,ToastMe
Don't think of yourself as a lapsed ceramicist.  Think of yourself as someone with the educational foundation to take a broader look at the world and apply your creativity towards other areas of personal growth.,3,ToastMe
If that mug is anything to go by you are going to ace the ceramics world and live every minute!,3,ToastMe
I LOVE that mug!  Do you have an online store? I'd love to buy one!,3,ToastMe
As long as you're happy is what matters,3,ToastMe
"Your mug is absolutely beautiful and it's obvious by its quality that you love doing ceramics, you can do a good business on Etsy and if so please let us know because I'd definitely want to but one of those mugs!! (Btw, I love your hair!!)",3,ToastMe
"You’re going into an artisanal trade :) no matter where it goes having a skill that you’re passionate about will bring value to your life. There’s always time to reassess if you need to, and for now you’re making the best choice for yourself.

Ps - great hair.",3,ToastMe
"People choose ""practical"" degrees because they're driven by fear of the future. You're doing something driven by love. Some people will think that makes you an idiot, but that just shows their fear and their ignorance because they've never met someone with a passion before. 
You're not an idiot — you're passionate. Which is surprisingly rare. 

Be proud that you're not afraid to do something for yourself and to enjoy the present, rather than out of paranoia for the future and to please everyone else.

I promise you there are many people twice your age who are only now just getting into ceramics or whatever their passion is, because when they were young they felt pressured to follow the crowd. They had to learn the hard and long way that there is no valid reason not pursue something you love, and their biggest regret now is not doing it sooner in life. 
I promise that those people will either admire or envy you.

Hope this helps. You're absolutely doing the right thing ❤️",3,ToastMe
"To quote Jim Carrey, you can still fail at something you're miserable doing. If you do what you love,  at least you can always feel honest about it.",3,ToastMe
"I think you should setup a online store selling your ceramics, I'm sure there are plenty of people interested in buying unique items, bit of a niche.",3,ToastMe
"That gorgeous! I’m doing sorta the same thing. Keep your chin up, if you love what you do it will never seem like work. 😊",3,ToastMe
"Hey man, ceramics is HARD. I'm a fellow fine arts major and struggled HARDCORE in the one ceramics class I had to take as a requirement. That you've majored in it is a testament to all the hours spent in the studio, working your butt off to master the craft you love. I admire you for it!",3,ToastMe
"When the world inevitably collapses you’re going to be killing it making mugs future generations will find, that’s more than most can say...",3,ToastMe
You are an unsung Hero who deserves a big hug! Thank you  for your hard work!,3,ToastMe
God bless,3,ToastMe
"You're a star. I work in healthcare too, and my family is far way. I'm worn out and I do do shifts or work in the front line (waves in NHS Pharmacy Tech) so I've no idea how you manage.

Thanks for the care throughout the struggle!",3,ToastMe
"There's not enough thanks that I can give to you and everyone else in the healthcare field right now. I can only imagine how hard it is for you, working basically non-stop on top of the isolation. It takes a spectacular kind of person to do what you do. Everything you've done and given hasn't gone unnoticed. Stay strong brother, we can get through this! And again, thank you for everything. Much love.",3,ToastMe

Thank you so much for everything you’re doing,3,ToastMe
"You’re a hero...

The thing about heroes is that they do not simply spring up out nowhere.  A hero is a hero because of the trials and tribulations they go through.  They are the strongest of us because they have seen the worst this world has to offer.

I’ll most likely never meet you, however just knowing that you’ve saved someone’s mother, father, daughter, grandmother... i feel blessed to be in your presence.

On the opposite side...your empathy for those that have been lost will not be forgotten.  The families of the departed will be truly grateful knowing an angel was there for their loved one when they couldn’t be.

Thank you for the sacrifices you’ve made and will continue to make.  You truly are a light in the darkness 💚",3,ToastMe

What you are faced with is a Herculean task, pushing yourself beyond your limits.  You're in unchartered water and you get to make the rules.

"Great job!!  Only **you** can define who you are, what matters most and what your value will be in this world.  No one can take that from you if you won’t let them.

I can relate a bit.  I failed out of community college and became a father by 20yrs old.   I was the shame of my family and a general failure at life.  But I wanted to be a father to my daughter and redeem myself.

It was a long hard climb from the bottom, but 20 years later I run a team of 17 sales reps for a fortune 1000 tech company, I manage a $25M annual budget and finished 2019 as the #1 sales manager in my company.  Today I’m a husband, a father of three children, a home owner and a contributing member of my church community.

Cheers! ☺️",3,ToastMe

"Congratulations on your accomplishments.  I, too, was told pretty much the same by several teachers.  It feels good to look back and see how wrong these folks are.

I wish you the best of luck on imparting the same drive to your students.  They don't know it yet, but they'll be lucky to have you.",3,ToastMe

"I was aways told to hold your head up. When you get kicked down, you gotta pick yourself up and dust yourself off. Theres a race to be run, theres some fun to be had. Its that moment when you feel like you cant pick yourself up again that that special someone will come around and pick you up. Theres someone who you thought will never love you for you, but theres someone for everyone. You may look in the mirror and see an ugly, worthless nobody. But theres someone who'll adore looking at you. They'll find everything unique about you and hold you closest to their heart. They'll do anything and everything to love you and be close to you and know more about you. Please dont give up. The world is a better place when everyones in it.",3,ToastMe

"Suicide hotlines are still pulling that shit!  About 25 years ago I called, and kept getting put on hold. After two hours of being put on hold off andon, and not getting to speak more than 20 seconds every time I WAS off hold, when the guy tried to put me on hold again and asked if I’d be ok for a minute, I said NO, I CALLED THE SUICIDE HOTLINE BECAUSE I AM IN TROUBLE. I’M NOT TRYING TO ORDER PIZZA HERE. 

He kept putting me on hold, and I said fuck it and hung up.  Somehow made it through the night, being fairly certain I’ve got to be one of the bigger losers on the planet —even the suicide hotline won’t talk to me. 

Spoke to my sister some time down the road about it, apparently the same thing happened to her. 

So if it helps at all, you are NOT the only one this happens to; you’re not an exceptional loser, they’ve done this to their fair share of people. Bad training? Underfunded/understaffed?  Who knows?  It’s pitiful. 

You hang in there. Life sucks now, and it’s alright to suck right now. That’s just where it’s at.  Every single thing has its ups and downs, and for a lot of us, the first 40 years of childhood were the worst, but eventually things do look up. 

Even for now, the odd thing that’s in your life that is good, concentrate on those things. Whatever dumb stuff there might be, a new box of crayons or the fact you can get your kettle shinier than it was when you bought it, or the smell when it rains or those little violets that come up in the grass that you like so much. That little stuff, keep an eye on that. Your life WILL ABSOLUTELY be worth living. It is now, but you don’t see that, and that’s ok. You don’t need to. We do. 

Hang in there. You deserve it. If nothing else, hang in to spite the suicide hotline. :]. Hugs.",3,ToastMe

Great choice! as a fellow 1-termer.,3,ToastMe
"I did 10 years in the Navy but then got hurt & medically retired. I just recently finished my degree.

I know you're nervous for this next chapter, I was too.  BUT YOU GOT THIS! You've been through more than the majority of your classmates. You know how to focus on the mission at hand and get it done.  Take those experiences and and move forward. But don't be afraid to ask for help.

You're going to be great, and you'll be so happy that you took this path to success.

If you ever need someone to vent on about the stresses, please message me. Vets in college have some unique stresses, and I'll always be here to listen.",3,ToastMe
"I always said after my first enlistment that I was getting out. I couldn’t stand the navy. I am now at 22 years in. I always tell my sailors, the navy isn’t for everybody. If you like it, stay in. If you don’t get out. Just make sure you have a plan and hopefully saved money before you get out. Congratulations on your new freedom and thank you for your service. I wish you the best of luck. Let the journey begin!",3,ToastMe
"Cool.

I was assaulted by my shipmates as I slept in the navy and the top two responses I get when I mention it are, ""You desereved it,"" (By people who weren't there and had no context other than it happened) and ""Get over it.""

Sweet world I live in.  Congrats though.",3,ToastMe
Okay but I'd slaughter for those eyebrows,3,ToastMe
"I know the feeling. I really do, not a day goes by where I don’t get that sinking feeling that I am not putting enough work or effort into my academics. As such if I am not studying it feels like something is going wrong up in my head. But due to introspection I know that is false, we are not superhuman. Though your parents/guardians/teachers may bully you to the point where you get red tears because “you aren’t working hard enough”, the best course is to ignore it, as hard as that may seem. It’s your life, not theirs. Do study, do your best but not to the point where it hurts you. 

I can tell from from however far away you are that you are intelligent,an idiot wouldn’t try and seek some sort of help (save for some circumstances ofc), diligent and thoughtful.

"Hey I feel your pain man. Ive felt disgusting because of my weight alot in the past and never felt like changing anything because I felt comfortable in feeling like sh*t

Ive been using the current situation as a way to get out of these habits and to finally eat healthily and exercise. 

I know exactly how much of a drag it can be to get myself to work out, eat healthily and so on, but I gotta tell you that it is COMPLETELY  in your grasp. You seem on the best way you could be on and I believe that you have the drive to go and get your dream body! 

Keep up the awesome work man, I believe in you",3,ToastMe
What a great smile! You look very handsome in both pictures. You got this!,3,ToastMe
"Great job!
I don’t know how your self worth has been shaped and why you think you’re disgusting being heavier, cause you’re not. I’ve been a chunky monkey my whole life and while I was younger, I hated it. As I got older and have many relationships I have noticed that those relationships were more successful when I felt good about myself and started loving my body and my mind. I definitely have bad days, like everyone does, but I at least know that the people I have around me love and support me, no matter my size. As long as YOU are happy, that’s all that matters. Big or small, love yourself. You have a beautiful smile and you look like you would be a great friend to have. Good luck on your journey. ❤️",3,ToastMe

You’re not ugly. Please don’t talk about yourself that way. There’s a lot of power in words.,3,ToastMe
I don’t see an ugly guy in either of those pics. What I do see is someone with a great smile and amazing charm. Your words tell me you are striving to do those things that bring you joy.

"It’s been six years for me and I thought the same as you when I first quit. It’s hard, but it gets easier as time passes. The pride you feel every year when you remember that you stopped is really something you need to let yourself experience. I smoked about a pack a day for 15 years before I quit. You CAN do it.",3,ToastMe

Smoking is a slow-motion form of suicide.  You do not want to spend the last few years of an anticipated long and happy life suffocating an inch at a time. You are so strong! You can do it!

I am SO proud of you. I’ve been there. And remember you are blessed to have made it through your addiction. Stay clean for your precious baby! You got this!!,3,ToastMe
"As a child of a parent who did not give up her addiction (and it ruined our relationship), I want you to know that EVERY day you choose your health and your child’s health over your former addiction, it sends us the message that we are worthy of your love. Tell your baby every day when you make that choice to choose to heal yourself and keep them safe. And please be honest with them later, hiding our faults can create resentment and distrust. 

Never hide your scars, they are proof you survived the battle ❤️",3,ToastMe
"Your journey is a different one, so don't compare. You are exactly where you are suppose to be and you are finding your perfection.

"You got this man. I defended when I was 31 (6 years total), so I know your pain very well. You're gonna make it, and be much better for it :)",3,ToastMe
"You're doing great. Grad school and PhD work take time and you're very young yet still. You're further along than most! I know the stress and constant work and strain makes life seem bleak at times though. I get it. I understand comparing your life to friends or the general public and feeling disappointed with what you were dealt. It's okay. It's natural for those feelings to pop up, for anyone. 

Not sure what field of work you're getting into, but you must feel passionate about it in some way. I know sometimes in graduate programs it's hard to keep the fore going with the constant work and hustle though. You got this. You really do. And your life is gonna be great! Prolly is great right now, even with no marriage or kids at the moment. 

You're a handsome dude! After this hard work itll pay off and you'll find the one and itll all fit into place.",3,ToastMe

But really, I’m proud of you!! I know you’re kicking ass on your PhD program! 🤘🏼🤘🏼",3,ToastMe
"You got through two years before, you can do it again.",3,ToastMe
"You are not stagnating. Also, it is perfectly okay to feel overwhelmed and tired. Try to remember in those moments when you feel like this, that you are putting time and effort into something worthwhile. All things containing great value and take time to achieve. How you contend with the low moments whilst striving for something important says a great deal about you as a person. 

It's okay to not be invincible, what's important is refusing to let the occasional low moment make you doubt your own ability to succeed and achieve in life. The only person you need to be happy and make peace with, is you. Do not be unfair to yourself through thinking that you need to compare to anyone. You are enough precisely as the person that you are. Never let yourself think otherwise. Regardless of what happens going forward, you can do anything that you put your mind to. Life is full of endless possibilities and you have unlimited potential. I am certain that you will find your way.",3,ToastMe
"You literally already did the thing! To get a PHd you gotta a base degree first, right? 
If you did it the first time, you'll do it again. You're stronger than you think - and already half done.",3,ToastMe
Those are the whitest teeth I’ve seen,3,ToastMe
"Duuuude you look like an absolute alpha to me, working on a phd while 29. Im 22 and already feel like my brain is dying",3,ToastMe
I’m 19 with aimless ambition and seeing you succeed gives me hope. Motivates me to keep moving forward and not to stay stagnant. You’re on a pursuit of your own happiness and liberation. After this the world is actually your playground. So go make change for the betterment of us we appreciate you!!,3,ToastMe
"The more you know and experience, the more you'll perceive what you do as insignificant to the endless possibilities you uncover. You are growing and doing very impressive things but it's hard to see that when it's a work in progress. You will find your fit, and you should be proud that you take the road less traveled.",3,ToastMe
"Your studies must be very rigorous but you are on a great path, other things will come when it’s their time.",3,ToastMe
when he’s cute and smart !!,3,ToastMe
Woah! A PhD? That’s awesome! Hard work pays off and in two years you’ll feel super proud of yourself.,3,ToastMe
"Speaking from someone who is also in a PhD program, first of all congrats! It’s impressive that you’re in one so never forget that. Second, we all compare ourselves to others in similar and different situations. Be happy and proud for your friends but know you’re doing what is best for you! Give yourself a pat on the back!",3,ToastMe
You have such a nice smile. :),3,ToastMe
"What an accomplishment to achieve. Don't stress too much about what your friends are doing. Focus on your own goals and where you want to be in life. You will get there, one day at a time.

If you lived in my state I would so ask you out. You look so handsome.  😘",3,ToastMe
I believe in you! You're going to pull it off just awesomely and then you will get some needed rest. Everything will fall in place. You're great that you decided to take the PhD! Not many are so brave or determined. You're simply fantastic!,3,ToastMe
What's your PhD in?,3,ToastMe
"The harder the work, the bigger the payoff my guy",3,ToastMe
"Don't push yourself too hard, take good care of yourself because burn out is real. You'll be ok, don't worry too much about running out of funding/time. It'll work out. (My colleague took 8 years on her dissertation!) We're rooting for you!",3,ToastMe
Bro!!!! That's so awesome you're almost there. Just remember everything good comes with time.,3,ToastMe
"Yes, it's exhausting and depressing. To tell you the truth, you gonna have to play your cards right, right after you finish your PhD, if you do not want to make permanent the 'others progress quicker in life' feeling. 

But, oh boy, going through a PhD process will transform you on so many levels as a human being... at some point in life you'll see there is a huge gap between you and all those friends who have not had a PhD.

Your perception of life, your grasp of various dynamics, your analytical thinking and intellect... Basically you'll be a boss.

And good thing is that... your friends will know. Talking from experience.",3,ToastMe
"I'm a master's student so I know how you feel! I've applied to get my PHD this year and the frustration have already began lol 
But don't give up! You can do this, it has already been 2 years, the other 2 will go on smoothly. Wish you the best and remember that in a world so anti-intellectualism as the one we live today, studying and applying yourself can be an act of resistance",3,ToastMe
"You can still have all of those things if you want but when you eventually do you will likely have more money to support your family, in addition, with a PhD I would think you’re more likely to find a job you really love. You will have increased job satisfaction and therefore feel more satisfied with your life. You can do this, you’ve already made it this far!",3,ToastMe
Goddamn... you are super fine. Yummy 😋,3,ToastMe
Message me if you want some nudes to relive some stress ;),3,ToastMe
You got this!!!   You are WINNING.,3,ToastMe
"Working toward a PhD is a lot of work and an accomplishment on its own! I'm sure your friends are as proud of you as you are of them. Everyone has different needs and goals - they're where they need to be in their lives, and you're where you need to be in yours. Don't lost heart!

On another note, I think you're really cute. You have a nice smile and kind eyes.",3,ToastMe
"Everyone's journey is different friend. If we compare ourselves to other people, no matter who we are, we can find reasons to be unhappy. But what is special is that you have stuck with school this far and it is all going to pay off soon! Few people can say they have a PhD and you should be proud that you are going the distance and have gotten as far as you already have. Not only that, but you are a good looking guy and I am sure you will find someone who genuinely completes you some day. What is your PhD going to be in?

Edit: and DAMN you have some nice teeth!",3,ToastMe
"You’re killing it. I know it feels tough now but you’ve made it through the hardest part and on the other end is fucking doctorate. Go get that PhD! 

You’re also incredibly handsome and if we lived in the same place I would almost certainly have to build up the courage to ask you on a date. 

You’re going places friend! P.S, I’m currently trying to buy a house and I also feel inept and overwhelmed so same same 🤷‍♀️",3,ToastMe
Uh Hello?!! GREAT TEETH and a PHD...you are going to find someone and be the happiest that you can provide for them... Good Luck!,3,ToastMe
"Wow okay first off you're very attractive, second way to go for working towards your PhD! Although your friends may be in different places you're doing you and that's okay! As long as you're happy working towards your goals that's all that matters. You got this and I wish you the best of luck!",3,ToastMe
Great smile!,3,ToastMe
"Don’t compare your Chapter X to your friends/families Chapter Z. You got this bro! Take it one step at a time, one day at a time! While you’re pursuing this academic endeavour, which is impressive in itself, take the time to do something you enjoy (a hobby).",3,ToastMe
Breathe in... breathe out... your half way there... you’ve got this!!!,3,ToastMe
"You are setting up the rest of your life! Earning your PhD will be one of the biggest accomplishments of your life. It may feel like the years are endless, but they are not. Keep going! You’re getting there! And you have all the time in the world to do all the other things you want to do in life! From one PhD student to another",3,ToastMe
"DUDE YOURE PART WAY THROUGH YOUR PHD, THAT'S SOMETHING TO BE AMAZINGLY PROUD OF.
Like sure they're having families and shit but by the time you're done you'll legit be a world class expert in something. That's fucking rad as hell dude.",3,ToastMe
Try not compare your life with others. I learned that the hard way. You are doing great. Just keep it up. You have a lovely smile!,3,ToastMe
"Dude, you're in a PhD program. That's not being stagnant, that's being smart and determined and hard-working and putting the effort in to put yourself closer to your own life goals. You're on a different track than your friends right now, but that's okay, you're all awesome and you're all reaching toward the lives you want. So please be sure to save a bit of that pride for yourself, because you've got a lot to be proud of. :)

I bet you are tired as all heck though, because you're working your butt off! Get some rest as you can and keep working hard, you're going to kick butt. 

I hope you have an awesome day!",3,ToastMe
"You are extremely attractive! I love your smile and your eyes are adorable. Keep pushing through with your degree, the pay off will be worth it!",3,ToastMe
"Okay but how can you be THAT cute and handsome while you're ""inept, overwhelmed, tired""??
you're not stagnant at all, you're working on your PhD, research is a life project that we carry around on a very deep level. Just like an artist and his/her art! I'm rooting for you!!",3,ToastMe
"Give it two more years and you’ll be jumping into the marriage and kiddy pools too.

Also, wow you’re hot.",3,ToastMe
"You don't need kids or a family to be an awesome individual anyone can have a baby but you? You my friend are working so hard for somthing so few people have and it will all be worth it in the end!

And when you've done it you'll still have all the time in the world to do everything else!


You are an amazing, intelligent, strong minded(....and goddammit sexy) individual. You're on the right track and you're doing great well done!",3,ToastMe
"Dude, no.  You're not stagnating, you're doing different things.  Don't let anybody convince you otherwise.",3,ToastMe
"It can be a long journey to get to where you want to be. Enjoy the time you have now, dont spend it wishing you were doing other things. 29 is young!  Take advantage of life, make a list, do things they can't. You'll get the things you want. You are doing amazingly.  Dont measure your own progress against others, know that you are smashing it. All the best!",3,ToastMe
"Keep it up, Homie! You got this!",3,ToastMe
"Just take your time,everything will happen for you. Just because you're not in the same place as your friends right now doesn't mean anything. Focus on that PhD!!! Be successful and your children will never have to go without and your spouse will be comfortable too!!! You are freaking hott too so, you got that going for you also lol you got this!",3,ToastMe
"Sure, your friends are in a different stage of life but you seem to be doing well, yourself considering you'll soon be getting a PhD! Also echoing the top comment's sentiments that you're handsome to boot!",3,ToastMe
"Hey, your on a runway about to take off in life. I've just made my first application to a university and I'm 40! 

You've got this. When you make that family your jealous of you'll give them a good start with plenty of funds, a stable background and plenty of life experiences.",3,ToastMe
"And children's doesn't mean your more or less worthy.

Being married doesn't mean you're don't deserve love. Be proud of yourself. You say that many of your friends aré getting married and having kids. But how many of them have a PhD? I bet not many.

You do you my man. I'm personally childfree and don't regret it one bit. So, instead of having kids and marrying because that's what's everybody do. Think. What do YOU want?

You want kids? You feel it in your heart? Do you want to marry?

I for example want to be a writer. And it's difficult. And myself family and friends think it's a waste of time. But I love it. And I won't stop doing it

So that's my advice just, be authentic and live in line with your beliefs and your goals",3,ToastMe
You're very handsome. No insults here!,3,ToastMe
"You’re incredibly handsome and hardworking! 
Please don’t compare yourself to others when you are on your way to something that people wish they had! 💕",3,ToastMe
"It is possible that some of your friends that are getting married see you and wish to be smart and educated as you are! We always see the achievements of the others and forget about what we have. It is normal I guess, but please do not understimate yourself. Good luck :)",3,ToastMe
A cutie about to get a degree hotter I would say,3,ToastMe
"Grass is always greener! They probably wish they were in school, not chasing around little kids. You're doing great 😁 it'll be worth it in the end! You'll have plenty of time to buy a house, etc!",3,ToastMe
"A PhD is incredibly hard work - keep it up, you’re so close and imagine that feeling when you’re done and dusted! I compare myself to my friends as well, but it’s never helpful. There’s no bloody point, either - plus, they may well be jealous of your life! Human beings are funny things.
Also, have to say it: you’re a flipping beaut.",3,ToastMe
"Man, I have felt that same exhaustion through my MSc program, and sad some days to say that I could not handle it at the time and quit. But I remind myself that I needed to get perspective and try my hand at something else apart from academics. I can appreciate your efforts towards your PhD and hope that you can be proud of the work you do and commitment you show for your studies. It takes a gritty kind of person to tough out that many years of education and research. I think one day, you will look back on this time and see how much you've grown through the most challenging times of your life. I wish you all the best and congratulate you on your progress towards a doctorate, one day life is going to pick up for you and you will look back on this experience fondly.",3,ToastMe
I didn’t finish mine until I was 40. I have no kids and no wife. Doesn’t matter. I’m happy. The only timeline that matters is yours!,3,ToastMe

"I've only tried to come off Anxiety meds a couple of times - so what i've experienced is NOTHING compared to your struggle, but I didn't even last 3 days before I took the easy way out and went straight back on them!

What I do know is that experiencing life in its' raw, bare state after you've used to chemicals shielding you from it is tough - there's a reason not many people can make the transition ... but I envy those that can. You can truly call yourself human and feel everything the brain and heart is capable of.

I can see a sparkle in your eyes and a sense of pride - you're building something great!",3,ToastMe
"Well done, that's a massive achievement! Keep at it. You got this.",3,ToastMe
"36 days!?!?! That is a HUGE accomplishment! I’m sure you realize how difficult the first few days were.  Could you have even imagined being at 36 days back on day 1 or 2? You’ve achieved the impossible! Now, just treasure this accomplishment every single day - every moment, and this number will grow and grow. A good friend of mine recently hit the 25 year mark! You are on your way there too! Don’t let any negative thoughts or hard days tell you otherwise. You’re doing great!",3,ToastMe
Toast to you!!! One day you will wake up and it will no longer be the first thing you think about. Stay strong and stay determined.,3,ToastMe

"My girlfriend broke up with me yesterday. I loved her so much. She says its not my fault, but of course she would say that lol. If i had done things differently, im sure I could've saved us. She stopped loving me and to be honest i didnt take it well. My mind was racing with whys and hows and denial. I was stern with her about it and wrongfully so. We could have sat down and talked about it for a few hours, but i was going too crazy to let that happen. I ended the conversation 10 minutes in. So much left unsaid. I kinda blocked it out yesterday and distracted myself. This morning i dreamt about her and about a guitar song that i promptly woke up and started playing. I cried so much. I miss her. Her laughs. Her smiles. Her hands. Her warmth. Her hilarious sense of humor, her taste. Her kindness. She was so kind. And its a constant teeter totter from this despair and hopelessness, to hope for the future. Hope that she'll find someone too. That he'll take care of her the way i wanted to. Hope that I'll move on. That both of us in the end are ok and we'll still think about each other. That I can take what i did wrong and do it right next time. When will that next time be? Idk. But the best thing for both of us would be to move forward with our heads up and arms out, ready for that next someone to make it all better. But these next few weeks, maybe months, are gonna be really hard. Not having someone to call, laugh with, hold. But time heals, i know that. We just have to wait until slowly, bits at a time, we find peace. Thank you for making this post. It let me get all this out. And i really hope you can make it through this with me. With all of us who feel the same.",3,ToastMe
"Everything hurts right now and that’s normal but don’t forget the person you *are* not defined by anybody else but brilliant because of you!! Every meandering step is a learning curve that teaches you so much. You will be stronger. This too, shall pass.",3,ToastMe
"I really wish I could tell you it's okay, and very soon you'll be over it.  In most cases that is bullshit.  Its gonna hurt maybe really bad.  I'm 6 months out from my breakup, shecl was 44 coming off an abusive marriage,  I'm 30.  You can imagine what that was like.  I loved her too, I thought she did me.  She cut me clean dead after everything.  I'm still broken, I still cry, most days.  However, it's not as bad as it was.  It's gotten better.  I'm focusing on me, I dont fancy anyone rn.  That's okay.  You're gonna feel all sorts of shit, gonna be hard but I can assure you it does get easier.  Wont seem like it now.  Probably  gonna have sleepless nights and mo appitite for a little bit, that shit will go away.  You'll feel better and I'm sure you'll find someone who is head over heels for you.  You're really pretty and I'm sure so much more.  

You'll get there, focus on you.  Do not blame yourself.    Learn.  

You will get better that o can promise, even if it's not straight away.  I dont normally do this but if you need someone to talk to, I'm always open.  I need someone at times too.  Ww still have to pick up the pieces yourself but it does help. 

Stay in there",3,ToastMe
"You are gorgeous, and so strong for having the courage to walk away. I had a similar experience a couple years ago. I was engaged to a man who turned out to be a sociopath. He pretended to love me until he got bored of me, and then the emotional and psychological abuse started. It’s been a long road to recovery, but I thank God I didn’t marry him.

"You are going to realize how truly strong you are as a person one day (maybe you even do now). I’ve been there man. Parents fought, I never really saw what love was. You feel hopeless and broken but the best part is... you can stop that cycle and be happy... especially when you’re on your own (college for example). Now I couldn’t be happier, even with the broken pieces. You hang in there man, it takes a strong person to be in your shoes. But Don’t let this alter your view on move. It’s out there! And that’s coming from someone who was cynical and skeptical of love so many years. 🙂",3,ToastMe

"Hey man. I’m just one person here and I went through this when I was about 15/16. Staying together for the kids is bullshit. I’m sure you’d love to see your parents work it out but sometimes it isn’t the answer. I thought that until I saw how happy my mom was after the dust settled. Now as an adult I understand that kids don’t benefit from being collateral damage in a relationship that doesn’t work. 

The trick is to figure out how to be amicable with both sides. When everything happened I had to choose a side and luckily for me it was easy. I’m good with both sides now but it took some time. I had to grow up and consider things from a third perspective that my 16 year old self didn’t consider.

"***Hey, congratulations 2U.***  Your hard work has paid off.  Don't blame your family for not being more supportive or enthusiastic.  They just cannot appreciate what you've achieved since none of them have been to college.  They just can't relate and it's totally understandable.  I know firsthand as I was first generation to go to college, too.  It is a decision that will change the trajectory of your future and you won't regret it.  Be prepared to work hard though.  Harder than high school for sure. In the meantime, enjoy the moment.  KUDOS!",3,ToastMe

"I am the only one of my immediate family to even finish high school much less go to University and I got a ton of apathy as well and it's like ""WTF MAN?"" but I figured out pretty early, you take care of you and their opinion is rooted in not understanding, or having to reframe their world so that your accomplishments don't matter so that they don't feel bad about themselves. I *personally* think what you have done is awe-inspiring, that is a ton and ton of work and man, congratulations! Also wow you're pretty although you didn't ask that I would feel remiss if that wasn't added.",3,ToastMe

"Congratulations!! Five full ride scholarships means five universities care. And care enough to offer you the resources needed to educate yourself. Universities don't do that unless they see potential. Too often we listen to people around us and believe what they say to be true. But reality might hit us differently. This is a instance of how real world believes you have potential, despite your family not caring.  Don't be saddened by those around you who criticize, instead, focus on making the most of this opportunity. The best way to silence critics is by proving them wrong. Good Luck!!",3,ToastMe
The family of yours who doesn't care can all go shit in a hat and punch it. Those scholarships are ***yours***. Remember all of this when at least one of them eventually comes and tries to guilt trip you out of money in the near future.,3,ToastMe

"You did something that most people will never do (full-ride scholarship) and did it 5 times, while being a first-gen low-income applicant. You're a rather impressive person, and I know you can rock whichever program you attend (as well as a nice haircut!) It might not always be easy, but once you get through it you'll look back and be grateful you pushed through.",3,ToastMe
"Aww hun. I feel you on this one. You should be proud of you. It's not easy to get scholarships. It takes dedication and determination that I feel is beyond most young adults capacity. I congratulate you on that.  You just keep up the good work and reap the benefits later in life :)

Also, don't take what they say to heart. Some people just really don't know how to pay a compliment or it makes them uncomfortable. I'm sure they're very proud of you but are having trouble expressing it.",3,ToastMe

"Congrats for beating Colon Cancer!

I don't want to distract from your post, but I just wanted to point out that people our age are coming down with colon cancer at a much younger rate than our previous generations.

I was diagnosed with a large colon polyp that was cancerous this year as well, and was luckily removed with no issue, though some people, like OP, aren't as lucky (but still pretty lucky to even have caught it!).

If you have any unusual symptoms in the bathroom, please just get the colonoscopy. I almost didn't and in 3+ more years I'd probably be in the same situation as OP, or worse. Don't dismiss anything just because you are under 50! Especially with any family history of early age polyps or colon/rectal cancer.

Just a PSA. I don't call myself a ' cancer survivor' because I didn't actually develop cancer yet, but we ARE survivors of this silent and often unspoken epidemic our current generation is going through. I imagine in 10-15 more years we will be hearing a lot of unfortunate stories.",3,ToastMe

You’re not only cute as a button but have fun quirky taste. (I’m talking to you 🍄)

As for your family being unsupportive... that’s terrible. Unfortunately we don’t get to pick our families. You’ll find your own tribe soon enough and be surrounded by all kinds of wonderful gay people and gay allies.

"As someone who doesn’t have a very supportive family outside of a few people, there opinions don’t matter. The only person that you should care about is yourself right now, and if they aren’t gonna be on your side then you can take their opinion with a grain of salt at best. Coming out of a mental hospital isn’t easy, especially during all of this corona stuff. You’re a very strong individual who’s actively trying to help yourself which I’m proud of even though I don’t even know you. Keep up the great work and you can handle this situation, I believe in you!",3,ToastMe
"I’m so sorry that happened to you. I couldn’t imagine putting my daughter through that. When she was 11 (now 12) I could tell something was bothering her. I asked her and she wasn’t ready to talk about it and I respected that. I simply reminded her that she could always talk to me. FF a few weeks. She asked if we could talk. She told me she was confused and thought she might be gay. Said she thinks she likes both boys and girls. I just hugged her and loved on her and she broke down in tears. She was crying bc she was happy that I didn’t judge her or treat her differently. (There’s more but this is long enough as is!) 

I say all of that to say this: As a mother, I can’t imagine doing to her what your mum did to you. No one deserves that. You are a beautiful young lady with the most adorable “sunshine eyes” I’ve ever seen. And though we have never met please know that I carry you in my heart and support you and I’m sending you the biggest, most comforting Mumma hugs.

You also look like maybe you tend to take care of a lot of other people and maybe don’t remember to take care of yourself as well; so I’m going to remind you that you are worthy of putting yourself first.

I know you're hurting, and I'll be honest, the pain doesn't ever really vanish after you lose a family member, but it does hurt less as the years go on. You might forget their voice, but you'll remember how they talk and what their smile looked like, how they laughed, and what their hugs felt like.  Sometimes a memory of them or a conversation you had together will pop up with no warning and suddenly, you'll remember what they sounded like just out of the blue. The pain never completely fades, but it does become a driving force. You're strong and you got this and you'll make her proud.",3,ToastMe

I'm 29 going back to school. You are more mature than the majority of your classmates I garuntee it. It's insane the immaturity of most my classmates. That alone will give you an advantage. Also just like you have your own life going on and whatnot. So does everyone else. Noone will give you a second look for your age. Probably just because your eyes are gorgeous. Good luck.,3,ToastMe
"I'm back at school. Half way done at 26. They way I see it is that most of my classmates are 8 years younger and I'm not interested in the big social life that comes with college. It gives me better focus and a more mature approach. I wish I was like this when I first went, somewhat.

No matter where you are in life it's never late to start something new. I'm worried my colleagues and friends will have years more experience than me in their respective fields, and they will. I see friends getting married and I havent been in a relationship for years.

BUT, that's their life. Not mine. At the end of the day we all have our own life to live and sometimes that takes a little time figuring out who you are and who you want around you.

I implore you, take the time to find out what you want in this life and then chase after it.

"I was so glad I went in my mid twenties. I was there because I wanted to be, not just because it was the next step, so I found I was a lot more focused and into what I was learning than the younger people around me. 

The breakup happening at the same time means you’re truly getting a fresh start/clean slate. And universities often have access to mental health support available to students, so that could be a great resource.",3,ToastMe
"Hi Man, I'm so sorry that happened.  I know heart ache and break and I really am sorry for your loss.  Try your best to keep your head up, it might take a long time to get over...and that's ok.  Keep focused on the positive and positive people. 

 You will be someone who knows the hurt and I like to think you'll be less likely to bring that hurt into the world for others....just focus on healing and go easy on yourself.  Take care",3,ToastMe

"I did this once. My hair was to the middle of my back (it doesn’t grow longer than that for some reason), and I shaved my head, because my wife cut her hair super short. Everyone was shocked because they knew how important my long hair was to me. My mom was particularly upset, and said that she wished that she could have at least said goodbye to it.

I regretted doing it almost immediately (I do not look good bald), and swore to never cut it again, except for trimming split ends and such. Ten years later, and I have kept my word.

Hair grows back. It isn’t who you are, either. As long as you are happy with it, that’s all that matters. Tell them they can suck it up.",3,ToastMe

"Oh my god people get so fucking hung up about hair! RIDICULOIUS! My family freaked out too when I shaved my head 20yrs ago. It's just hair!

You look beautiful! I love it!,3,ToastMe
"Your beauty is not in your hair, it is in your heart & in those gorgeous eyes. You can pull this look off, not too many can so show it off & be proud. I couldn't do that because my hair is half my personality and I wish that I could look half as amazing as you do with or without hair. Your family will get over it, it wasn't their hair.",3,ToastMe
"You are beautiful and they are just jealous that you can pull it off and they can’t!

"When you're in your teens, you feel like you've been alive for so long that things happening to you now are going to last forever, but take it from someone who is 23 years older than you are now, that so much changes as you get older.  I had a really hard time in middle and high school, being extremely small for my age, I was constantly criticised and belittled, but I stuck it out, because I didn't want to let the people that were tormenting me win, and I ended up being a much happier, much more self assured person for it.  


I'm not pretending to know your struggle, I didn't have an issue that divided me from my family, and I can't imagine that living like that is in any way easy, but as most of the comments here have said, sometimes your real family isn't the one you're born into, but the one you choose.  Things may seem bleak now, but there's so much more life to live, and if you give up, you'll miss a lot of things that will make you happier than you could ever imagine at this point in your life.  


Keep fighting, it's worth it.",3,ToastMe

You are so strong for even acknowledging who you are in the face of real adversity. My advice to you would be to think about your future, your first girlfriend, moving out and living on your own, getting pets, building a career and a life you want, exploring the world, maybe getting married and having kids if youre down for that.

Please seek someone to talk to. Therapy is such an amazing tool, and I'm really gutted I found it later in life. It takes a while to find the right person, but when you do, it is powerful. 

Meditating also helps a lot! There's this app called headspace, try it out, do the basics. They are really good at explaining the relationship between thoughts and feelings and what our role is amongst that chaos. I'm very early on in my meditating journey, but I know it is a game changer and I know if I started at your age, I wouldn't have to deal with the shit I had to over the last few months. 

Glad you took the first step and asked for help from this community, but please don't stop here. There are people out there in the world that love you and accept you and make you laugh. They are there I promise! You just need to manage your way through these thoughts and feelings you are having long enough to meet them, and you will meet them. Just continue to be a good person and you will attract good people. Good people are easy to spot :)",3,ToastMe

But I can safely say that I can now be happy with myself most of the time. And I know you can do it because you already started and thats the most awful part but it's really good to remind yourself that you will do what you need to be happy (one day). You are planting the seeds to sow, and you must be patient. I think my best advice is to focus on continual growth and not successes. Its a really wonderfully therapeutic perspective.

I'm really proud of you, and I hope you can overcome those anxieties.",3,ToastMe

Also love the protective phone case! consider taping yourself riding so you can how you look and see your growth.

"I’ve been to war and gone through opiate withdrawal.  I think I might prefer going to war, and I *seriously hate war*.  People who haven’t experienced it don’t understand how difficult opiate withdrawal can be.  You are literally sick when it happens, it’s very similar to having the flu - but that’s just acute withdrawal.  Post-acute withdrawal lasts quite a bit longer, and it’s no joke.

But you can make it.  The hardest thing is making it through the first & second day, at least that’s been my experience.  If you’ve made it that far, you’re already doing better than perhaps *most* but certainly a shitload of people.  That right there is a testament to your courage and strength.  If you don’t get this job, keep trying - it’s their loss, if you ask me.  The most important thing is your health, though.

In other words, what I’m trying to say is that the strength and confidence are already in you, because you were able to stop using opiates *and* you’re looking for work.  I know you don’t *feel* strong or confident, but you are.  Your story and post are proof of it.  I wish you the best, I hope you keep it up and that you feel better.",3,ToastMe

"You're going to get through this. Every solution has a problem. Rough patches in life are necessary because they allow you to distinguish between tough times and good times. They instill discipline. They make you a better person later. You will get through this. . And you'll come out on the other side a far better person and have a very good life.

Life always gives you options. You have the option to move back home and go to school there. You have the option of getting another pet or two, or even  becoming a foster parent until you decide what pet to get. You have the option of taking the semester off, working to make and save some money, and going back to school the next semester. One of the better options you have is to visit your primary care physician and asking them to refer a psychologist or psychiatrist to evaluate your mental health. You're living in a time where psychiatric medication for depression or other mental illnesses are the best they've ever been. They help millions of people get through a day, a week, a month, and a year. I'm proof.

Third (and I know you weren’t asking for advice in your post but just let me “mom out” here for a sec, lol), please let your professors know that you are going through a hard time right now. I’m a teacher and I always tell my students that I can’t help them if I don’t know what’s going on in their lives. We know that life happens.

First of all, you'll be okay. While I'm too aware about financial crisis and debt (I'm in so much debt that If I work at my current job for the next 10 years, and gave my entire salary to my debt, that's when I'll be free of it), I can tell you this, life gets better.
Failing classes is very difficult, but guess what, you can pass it. And I know you can. You're shook and sad, so you can't focus. But you definitely can. I do belive in you.

It sucks that you and your boyfriend are going through a rough patch. I can understand how much that sucks.

This struggle right now is only going to make you into an amazing person you'll be tomorrow. I am sure you'll come up from this, stronger than ever.
PS. You're an amazing person already, look at those glasses! And you've a cute nose.
Everything about you says you're a great person. And you'll kick the gear up soon as you're ready to fuck shit up for everyone.

And in case you're not okay taking money from strangers, what you can do is take it as an interest fee loan, keep in touch with them, and then pay them back once you've the money.
That way you gain a friend and make your situation a bit better.
I'm sure you feel there's no escape, but come what may, find solace in this; you'll always have a choice.
While the situations may suck, everything may suck, you'll always have a choice. That's your one true right.

So whenever you choose to stir things up everywhere, or choose to buck up for studies, or choose to simply let things turn out as they do, you'll be freer, knowing YOU made that choice, and it's your life, your control.

"You haven't seemed to replied to any of these comments and the I doubt you'll even see this one but here it goes.

I have been in a similar place on a grander scale, luckily I was already out of school when this all hit. I lost 4 very important people to me within a year, a close friend to cancer, my uncle, my aunt ( no relation ), and finally my mother. It was the absolute worst year of my life, like killing myself bad and I've never been the suicidal type. A week after my mothers funeral I was evicted from my home because I was waiting on checks from some organizations ( my job charity) to come in. 

This was 8 years ago and not killing myself or giving up on living and enjoying life was the best decision I ever made. Life still has had incredibly bad rough patches but after that year what could hurt me.

I know many people whom have severe clinical depression, I have the depressionlite version I don't get bad bouts too often, and all I can say is that it may not get better immediately, but it will get better/easier to deal with it.

You're young and strong enough to admit youre down and out. If You need to take people's charity to make it through do it, if it doesnt sit easy with you pay it back when youre in a better place. 

Ive been very blessed since my mother died to develop a great support system, and ive used that system but I also pay them back give them love and gifts.

You can do that too. Its gonna sound a little silly but I didn't have friends after I moved away from my family for a year and half. Where I got those friends? My part time job, I did restaurants but Really anywhere would do where youre not by yourself the whole time. You can develop friendship in those one on one conversations, that's how I developed my new family. It took me years I'll admit, but it's a doable thing to do so long as you stick it out. Youre at school, join a club, go to interesting talks that they give, you might meet some people and with ones that have similar interests. 

Really its just about connecting to people girl. Give your trust and don't break it, someone tells you some real shit don't tell anyone else. Its honestly as simple as that in alot of ways to build up that trust that leads to a real and true friendship and not just a partying bud.

You'll be okay girl you just gotta stick it out and look at the silver linings even if thats hard to do alot of time.

Good luck darling you'll be okay you got this!",3,ToastMe

Trans is just as beautiful as it is hard for people I guess. So I think you've already come a long way. About your dysmorphia, I recommend to seek professional assisstance!

"You have a sweet kind of vulnerability in your eyes & a very pretty face, you know, holidays are particularly brutal for many folks who suffer depression, i feel you, i grew up in childrens homes & never did the family thing for more than a few years in all, so xmas is a weird time for me too.

Don't put too much credence into what others say about your art journey, it strikes me that to hear others say such things, & see you sticking to your guns, shows you're driven to do what you love, you will find other like minded spirits in that community who are accepting & won't judge you.

I'll tell you something i learned once about putting myself under too much pressure. Way back in the day, someone did a study on people finding a new job, those that told themselves they were terrible at it & would never learn, ended up not doing so well & found succeeding difficult, many left, whilst those who told themselves 'It's ok, i'm new, like everyone else, it takes time to harness new skills & i will learn', did far better because they accepted they couldn't possibly know everything at once & everyone goes through a learning curve in new situations.

While the above is focused on new employment, what i'm sharing is the message within the story because it centres on an important point, the best relationship you can have is with yourself, talk to yourself as a trusted confident & reassure yourself that while yes, you may not feel the best today, it's ok, no one is perfect, everyone has frailties that are a personal challenge to them, it's how you approach those things that can be key to making it a little easier & accepting you might not be doing so well, but it won't always be that way, we can't always change our psychology, at least not without professional help, but we can ease those negative voices within us through positive  cognitive reinforcements, don't be so hard on yourself, you're a beautiful girl who is learning to find her way in the world, you're sticking to your guns by doing what you love, follow your intuition, if you're feeling low & can't combat it by yourself, reach out for reinforcement like you're doing now to enable others to support you when you're trajectory is off, & when you're in a better place, be that for others, it takes time to network, to find your own familial bonds, with others you trust, but you will get there, there are many others in this thread who feel the same, we believe in you hun.",3,ToastMe
You’re valid af! Happy holidays!,3,ToastMe

I hope your Christmas is going okay.  I know you said you are alone, but I still hope you are enjoying some me time and eating some good food. 

I’m 25 F. I also suffer from severe depression and body dysmorphia.  I get really anxious about bothering someone, so if you are interested, feel free to PM me if you’d like to talk and become friends. :) (or anyone reading this and also looking for a friend too.)",3,ToastMe

"Ah alone on Christmas, if it means anything we’d welcome you to our cheap Chinese takeout feast. Christmas is usually the hardest time of the year for most people. (Murder suicides increase this time of year). 

Things never really get better, it’s just that you don’t realize how strong you can be. When you move towards your goal despite the hardship of the hand you’re dealt, it makes you stronger than the suffering. 

To suffer, to oppose, to dream. Your story is bound in limitations but still it is laid bare to your character. Your life is an unchosen set of paints. Time is limited so make it elegant and worth your trouble.",3,ToastMe
You have such a natural beauty to you. Your eyes are gorgeous and all of your features compliment each other.,3,ToastMe

Your smile is so precious 😤💞,3,ToastMe
"I'm not trans so by no means I can understand your suffering but I do empathize with it. You're a beautiful and strong woman! I don't know if you were alone at Christmas because your family doesn't accept you as trans but I just want to say that we can choose our family. Sometimes we can get very hopeless but I assure that you'll find amazing people that support you and love you no matter what. From one artist struggling with depression to another, we will get there! :) Keep doing whatever you are doing and always be true to yourself. Good things will happen.

"You are *stunning*, and as someone who also struggles with severe depression, I know how low it can go. But a good thing is that you can channel it into your art, I don’t know if you’re more of someone who draws or someone who paints, but I find that putting all my feelings through strokes on a canvas is very comforting. Create something almost as beautiful as you are :) I can guarantee you that you will feel at least a little better knowing you can be proud of your own creation. I wish you the best of luck, and if you ever need someone to vent to or ask for advice, my PMs are always open ❤️",3,ToastMe

"Well first of all, you’re beautiful. When your body dysmorphia and self esteem try to tell you otherwise, refer back to the comments from the lovely people here to try to remember how the rest of the world sees you.

I like your handwriting,3,ToastMe
"Honestly you're beautiful. If you hadn't said trans woman I wouldn't have known you were trans, I would've just assumed you were a bio woman.

You're very brave for speaking your truth not only to yourself but also to those who are close to you. It's no easy task to admit something like being trans, especially this day in age. So here's a toast to your bravery and to your beauty, kind stranger!! I'll be sending love and good vibes at all times, so when/if people try to be shitty to you, just remember that there's at least one random redditor thinking about your bravery, and feeling inspired.

Please believe that you have more power than it. I don’t know if I have the right words to help or guide.

"You are very handsome, you have a lovely smile and great hair! This is a really nice photo. 

Most times when I take pictures of myself I hate them all, but I save them. Then when I happen upon them weeks or months later I look at them and think, ""these really weren't that bad, what was I thinking?"" Try looking at them again later, you might discover that you were just in your feels when you took them, and won't see the flaws you saw then.",3,ToastMe
"Nice shirt, where did you get it?",3,ToastMe
"Hey Man, have a great Wednesday.  A friendly smile to start the day, thank you.",3,ToastMe
"Such a friendly face, and a cute smile. And I like your glasses a lot. Keep your head up, comrade. The fact that you've gotten this far is a testament to how strong and kickass your spirit is. Take it one day at a time, until life is gonna start getting better. You've got this!! <3<3",3,ToastMe

I LOVE your glasses. Your smile in this photo seems genuine and approachable. I'd hang with you.,3,ToastMe
You have a beautiful smile❤️ you are a good looking young man. Anxiety and depression are not easy but help is available. Talk to your doctor or parent to start the road to recovery. Actually you have started the recovery by this post. It is a positive way to deal with a difficult time. Hoping you find a good therapist/doctor to help you through this. Positive thoughts and prayers to you❤️,3,ToastMe

"Their decision is a reflection of their character, it does not say anything about your worth. You’re absolutely beautiful, and I’m sure you’re a wonderful person.",3,ToastMe
"That's an absolutely horrible situation to be in. It sucks. Cry it out. Maybe talk to a therapist. Get it all out in a journal. You are not worthless just because one person cannot see your worth. You are a beautiful human and you deserve so much more than you were given. I have all the faith in the world that you will turn this chapter into something beautiful for yourself after you heal. Good luck and take care of yourself, my friend.",3,ToastMe
"I was almost the child in that boat. Instead it became a loveless and abusive relationship from that parent. You and your child are better without him. Even when you’re down you look like a positive person. I’m sure you’re an amazing mother. Your child needs you and you’re now priceless to them. Trust me, I know from experience it’s better to have one loving parent than two that despise you.",3,ToastMe
"My biological father left when I was 2 years old, I was too young to remember. I’m 26 now and it still has effects on my daily life. The largest of which is an incredible mom, like you, who chose to stay. You are going to have to wear both hats now. Just know, you are what I hope to be in a parent if I have children. You’re strong, stronger than you know. You don’t have to worry about anything other than today. Just love your son the best way you know how and make your decisions in both of your best interests, even when that decision seems hard and like tough-love. You got this mom! DM if you ever have questions from a fatherless sons perspective. Your son will grow up to be strong and kind, just like mom. Sending love and prayers.",3,ToastMe
"You are a caring person who committed to a partner. Your loved ones must mean so much to you. I can’t pretend to know what you are experiencing but if I can relate my life to yours, it’s like grief, right?

I don’t mean grief like a death. But grief from losing someone who you built your life with. Your hurt right now *will not stop you* from moving forward. You have a young son. And a family or family of friends as well? I believe someone like you would have a great many people who value you a great deal.

A little song which has always cheered me up goes “Makes new friends but keep the old, one is silver the other gold.”

Your worth is not measured by anyone but you. And you should know that you are worthy of loving yourself.

Your 2-year-old son needs you. And you need support as well. Reach out to the bonds which remain and strengthen them.

Sometimes I have felt I was worth less than nothing, and yet with the support of family and friends I survived my grief. You will as well. After all you are a special kind of strong: a caring mother.",3,ToastMe
"You're worthy and beautiful. I'm going trough a divorce since february, but girl do I feel good most of the time since the first big wave of pain is gone. My recently turned eight y/o boy and me have never been a better Team and I have found a beautiful loving man that I wouldn't change for the world. 
It's hard, I don't want to sugarcoat, but:
You.Will.Make.It. and you'll be happy again.",3,ToastMe
You don’t know it but your life just got better.,3,ToastMe
"Wow, so many comments.  

I would recommend “the four agreements” on YouTube.  

#2: don’t take anything personally.  It’s not about you, it’s about them.",3,ToastMe
"The circumstances don’t make the person. If your partner left with no explanation or attempt to make things right the deficiency is in their character. 

You’re a good person. This doesn’t make you anything different. You’ve got a 2 year old who loves you and needs you and to whom you are the meaning of life and love. 

You’re beautiful. Both inside and out. 

You’re strong. This burden is a struggle but you’ll lift it. 

And there’s a lot of good people here on Reddit who can see that, even if you can’t see it right now. 

You’re a good person, and it’s going to get better.",3,ToastMe
Sorry this absolutely sucks! Sending you so much love.,3,ToastMe
Hugs♥️,3,ToastMe
"You're beautiful and strong. Your son is lucky to have you as his mother. I can't predict the future, but I wouldn't be surprised if he grew into a young man who loves his mom endlessly. 

You can do this.

I've got a 3yo, so if you want to PM for advice, to vent, or just to share experiences please never hesitate!",3,ToastMe
"Well you dont need that person in your life since they did that. You are a strong woman and you got this, you're gonna be a great mother/father combo for this kid. And you are NOT worthless, and I believe in you",3,ToastMe
I love you. You are worthy and whole and loved.,3,ToastMe
"Sendin you massive hugs from across the pond. You have a lovely kind face but I bet you have an inner strength too, you can do this - you may have times when you think you can’t but you most definitely can :) I hope one day you’ll look back & not see this as a bad time in your life but a turning point from which lead to a very happy place.",3,ToastMe
"If he was that uncommitted to you and your son, he would have become worse and worse at being a father and a husband.  Your son will grow up to be a better person without you ex's toxic influence.  You are all your son needs to grow into an excellent young man.",3,ToastMe
"You can do this. This may be one of the hardest things you'll ever do, but you can get through it x",3,ToastMe
The fact you are reaching out and not giving up shows what incredible strength you have. Your child is so lucky to have you 💕,3,ToastMe
"You look like the kind of mom that's going to raise the best son the world has ever seen. So proud of you for reaching out for help. Its going to be okay. My mom committed suicide when I was 11, and it was soul-crushing, I could have turned out like her, but because my grandparents reached out and did their very best to love and take care of me, I turned out alright, and I know your son and you will too. You've got this girl. I can see the genuine-ness in your eyes.",3,ToastMe
"Oh sweety, I’m so sorry to hear that...  but you’re anything from worthless and at least you have your son and not that pos. You’re gonna make it through this because I believe in you and you’re strong enough to pull through this :)",3,ToastMe
"Wholesome thread is wholesome.

You will rebuild.
You are strong.
You can do this.",3,ToastMe
"The only person who is worthless in this situation is that man.
This is a chance for a fresh start! Be strong, and show that little boy all your love!! Nothing is more powerful than a mothers love, trust me. I was raised by a strong single mother. I wouldn’t be the man I am today without her. You got this!!",3,ToastMe
"Sometimes life gives us problems that we never caused, but we have to solve them anyways. You being here shows that you're strong, even if you don't feel like it. Seeing that inspires me to work hard in rough times as well, so thank you for opening up :)",3,ToastMe
"I'm so sorry that happened to you all you can do is take the time you need to slowly heal, surround yourself with people who love you and keep being a great mom.",3,ToastMe
Someday you will see all that you gained from this horrible situation. You and your son are better off without him.,3,ToastMe
"Temporary pain will be followed by a sense of freedom and clarity as all the warning signs that you ignored that he used to do slowly come out in the open in your mind and you realize you dont have to deal with that shit anymore and since your kid is young, they wont have to deal with it either!

You will then be equip with that new experience and knowledge if you ever look for another partner and you'll be less likely to put up with silly shit they do and you'll be better able to spot it. On a more positive side you'll be able to also spot the naturally good aspects of people, loyalty, maturity, respect etc.

At the end of all this, might be 6 months maybe a year, you will look back and realize that this biggest favor this dude ever did for you was to leave allowing you and your child to have a better life you both deserve.",3,ToastMe
"Congrats. You only had to put in two years with the leaver. This way you can build a life around a pillar of strength rather than someone who will bail. And yes, by pillar of strength I meant you...",3,ToastMe
"Your story is still being written. This may be a painful part of your life, but you can get through it and you'll be stronger for it. Don't be afraid to ask for help when it's needed.",3,ToastMe
Jeez what an asshole. Hope things get better for you and your son,3,ToastMe
"He is a fool for leaving. He had it all - a great life with a gorgeous, devoted wife and son. You'll see that you're better off without him in the long run, but I know that doesn't change how hard it is right now. Hang in there and lean on family and friends. It's okay to ask for help. I admire your courage.",3,ToastMe
You look like my mom... must be a sign of a great parent in the making!! 😄,3,ToastMe
"My father kicked me and my mother out when I was a little less than 6 months old. I don't think my life would have turned out half as good if he was in it. I am now a solicitor (England) and an Advocate (India). Now he keeps trying to find excuses to get in touch with me.

"I found out that my wife of 14 years had an affair for 4 1/2 years with a co-worker. It absolutely killed me and my kids. For a longtime, I felt worthless or like I did something wrong to push her away. I couldn't figure out what the hell happened. After 3 years and some serious soul searching, I have come to realize that it wasn't me. I was a great husband and father. I gave her everything she could ever want or need. I put her and my kids first. Always. She was a very selfish person who now lives with many regrets. I took me a while to get over it/feel like myself again but I'm a much happier person now.  I was fooling myself for a longtime. Keep your head up hun. The pain sucks, but you are a beautiful person and in time it will pass.

"It says a lot about that person that they can do that to not only you, but your son. It is a flaw in their character. It is them. It has nothing to do with you. Please remember that you could not have done anything to prevent it. Even if you felt like you could have done this better or that better, or looked like this or acted like that....please don’t pick at yourself. It is nothing you’ve done. 

Please go gentle on yourself and know it isn’t you. Surround yourself with family. Talk it out with a therapist. Know that you are still loved. <3",3,ToastMe

You are a good person going through a horrible loss, let no one tell you that you aren't allowed to grieve. There is no timetable for grief, everyone struggles with it in a different way. I have dealt with grief myself and have to say, your feelings are valid and completely okay to feel. You are doing the best you can right now, let that be enough, it's okay.

I am truly sorry for your loss, sending all the prayers and good vibes your way. Much love.",3,ToastMe

"You lost your life partner. You had planned to steer the ship together, and now you have to steer it alone, and that is an unimaginable pain. But you're doing it. Everyday that you put one foot in front of the other, you are doing it.

Your light is stronger than you know, and it will reach others in the dark. Hold your head up. Be proud. You can't do this.",3,ToastMe
"I think if your husband were able to speak directly to you now he would tell you thank you for mourning him and honoring your beautiful marriage, but also to remember some happy or funny moments of him and to focus on them, and that it is OK to allow yourself to be distracted from your grief by life. If you need to stay busy at work and with friends to get through, do that. And if you need to take a day off to lie in bed, do that. 

Also remember that healing is not a linear path. Sometimes it’s a bunch of swirly loops, or one step backward and two steps forward, or it simply stagnates at a plateau for a while. And that’s normal and it sucks, but please don’t beat yourself up or feel like “you should be better by now”. Be patient with yourself and trust that however long it takes is how long it takes. 

I don’t know what your husband was like, but feel free to tell us a story about him? There are some lovely subreddits for grieving partners that might offer good advice as well. 

Sending you hugs ❤️",3,ToastMe
"You’re a strong, sweet person.",3,ToastMe

"> Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.” The farmer said, **“Maybe.”** The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said, **“Maybe.”**   
>  
>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that’s too bad,” and the farmer responded, **“Maybe.”** The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said, **“Maybe.”**  
>  
>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of good fortune.

 This is a crazy time for everyone and I know it’s hard to face this uncertainty. Sometimes we get so focused on success as the goal we forget that working towards that goal in the first place is such an important step to getting out of a depressive state.

"Given your amazing taste in eyewear, many more things will come your way. Your glasses are so cool they make me and others want to get to know you.

Also, as tired and stressed as you look, you're still really pretty.

Remember, you didn't get sent home because of you, you got sent home because of the virus. As someone whose employer does business continuity, that's what 99% of the world's companies are driving for, getting back to normal ASAP. Think of your opportunity as \*delayed\* not dead.

"Depression isnt an easy thing to recover from. But you have beaten it before and come out on top. This quarantine sucks bc its forcing us all to isolate ourselves and that's the thing that'll pull the depression back in faster than anything else. 

I know you can stay strong though. Its tough, honestly I'm working on it too. The quarantine makes this shit hard, but keep your head up. You remind me of someone I used to know, incredibly strong willed and devoted to being their best self. 

A couple of things that I find to help with staying out of the pit of depression:

1. Don't lay around all day, being lazy is a very attractive idea, and don't get me wrong I do it all the time. But if you're just laying there sleeping or watching tv or playing video games, you're gonna start feeling the depression come back.

2. Talk to people, human connection is really important, because of the quarantine we obviously cant visit friends, so the next best thing is to FaceTime them. I try to FaceTime or call at least one friend every day, it helps keep me on the surface and prevents me from getting too lonely. If facetiming isn't an option you can always call someone, or if that's not gonna work either at least text someone. Its important to have human connection every day.

3. This one is pretty obvious, keep busy. There's a lot of things you could be doing to take your mind off of the dark parts of your life, if you have hobbies that's great, if not then there's lots of things to pick up around the house. 

I know this stuff isn't easy. If you need a friend, someone to talk to, I'm always here. Don't let yourself fall back down the pit, I'm rooting for you. Keep your head up. :)",3,ToastMe
Just want you to know I am in a similar situation. It hurts. I spent the last two years dealing with bad medical issues. I FINALLY was starting to feel better at the beginning of the year. Finally healthy enough to look for a better job. And enough energy to do social activities. Annnnd now this. So I am at home alone. Trying to not sit on couch and smoke green all day. Try to stay busy! Even if it’s just keeping your mind occupied mostly. Hopefully this will be over soon.,3,ToastMe
"It's funny you mention Armor. There's an amazing book concerning self-esteem and self-love by Emily V. Gordon (Kumail Nanjiani's wife) called ""Super You"" that I cannot recommend enough for helping me believe in myself after a lifetime of not.


One of her tips is about just that: armor. She says write out a list of all of the attributes about yourself that you like and are positive. Then, imagine each of those attributes being a piece of armor. Humor could be a shield, for example, and compassion could be sword. Go through your list and assign every attribute as some sort of armor or weapon. You could think of it as knight's armor, a gundam mech kind of thing, super hero outfits and utility belts, etc. Pick whichever you like best.


Then, when times are low, imagine that suit of armor and weapons of awesome traits around you. Let it be a mental place of power for you. 


That exercise is more helpful than any random compliment I could give you, but I'll throw in a few of those too! You're beautiful, I love your glasses and style, the matching shirt and jacket is a great look, and I feel like you're probably good at having deep conversations. Metta to you, and I hope things look up for all of us.",3,ToastMe

"I just got done with a long job retraining program after being unemployed for years, just as the virus hit. I was so excited to get a job!

I am applying for jobs in the industry and getting nowhere. The interviews I was offered just disappeared and I don’t know if they rejected me or what? I have no idea how they would hire me even if they want to if they cannot see me in person.

I went from complete optimism to waking up crying and barely able get out of bed.

The only thing that’s motivating me is I have nothing else to do but sit at my computer and apply and apply all day.

Telling you this so you know there’s many people stuck in the same place and we are all trying so hard.

Focus on keeping those numbers good. Laugh at the uneventful and boring. It is truly amazing what medicine is capable of. Look into a Ronald McDonald facility next to the hospital.

"I know every hour you can hold on is a huge success - that you’ve made it a week says everything about your strength and hope you’ll hold out even longer! You’ve got this mama, and I really hope you update when you have good news to share!

I’m sure 26 weeks feels like a long way away, but I had my firstborn at 26 weeks and he’s 4 now. My waters broke two days before he was born, but the hospital told me I had peed myself and sent me home. You are in the best place under the best care, you can do this!

When baby comes, give the doctors space and try not to read into every little thing that happens around you. It’s impossible, I understand, but just breathe and focus on remembering what’s happening rather than understanding it. Plenty of time for that. For example, when my son was born, they left him on the bed in situ for a while before they cut the cord and got on with things. At the time, I thought he was dead. (Doesn’t help that preemies don’t cry - you may or may not have been warned about that. Thankfully I was, but I’ve heard many people say otherwise. They can’t cry til past 30 weeks iirc) But I think a midwife noticed my panic and explained they leave the cord attached for a bit (a minute or so) to give baby those last nutrients and so they can examine him to make sure they’re giving him the treatment he needs. 

Please message me any time in your journey. Tell me what’s happening, about the beeps and machines in nicu, about the bitch midwife giving you shit about pumping, about the terror and elation, about the grief of not having the pregnancy you thought you would have. I get it and I’ll do my best to advise if I can.

We were told by every doctor that there were practically zero chances of making it to viability. My wife and I accepted the odds and pushed to be kept at the hospital in bed rest.

As long as you're healthy you can experience to the fullest also your situation is the opposite of mine because you have to gain weight I have to lose it but whatever your situation is the world will accept you for who you are so you can do what you want ignore bullies (I know your an adult but adult bullies still exist) because they just want to shame you even when there is nothing wrong with you even if they don't know your situation,2,ToastMe

"You look great! You should be so proud of yourself.

"Promise you as you keep going it just gets better and better. Soon you'll never want to look back! I battled anorexia for nearly 14 years and finally decided after nearly dying around a year and a half ago that I was done. Worked as hard as I could through treatment (fifth timewas the charm for me, I guess, haha) and it's all been uphill since then. I'm back to being able to work full time after 3 years barely able to get out of bed, working out and eating a ton to fuel my body, constantly get asked how I'm so happy all the time (because I really and truly am), healthy relationships... the list goes on.

I never thought it'd get better but man oh man. Keep holding on, I promise the life that's waiting for you is better than your wildest dreams.",2,ToastMe
"I really read this as a ""roastme"" post at first and I was like ""but... but i dont WANT to!"" Overcome, set goals, achieve.  Good on you.",2,ToastMe

Good for you that is so awesome!!! So proud of you!,2,ToastMe
"First of all, you are strikingly gorgeous. I also tried to kill myself over a year ago. I know what it feels like for your mind to be completely turned against you. I promise if you learn how to best take care of yourself, find the right medication (if necessary), and start being more compassionate to yourself, amazing things can happen.

One book I recommend is Tragedy + Time by Adam Cayton-Holland. Nothing has made me feel less alone when I needed it most.

Also, for what it’s worth, I regret going to college so much. Was a complete waste of time and money, at least for me.",2,ToastMe

"Are you kidding me with those cheekbones??? You're so stunning✨✨ likely stunning inside as well. You are here for a reason, and those schools just don't fit into your reason. Schools can be unforgiving and rigid, and for alot of people they don't work for them and it makes people feel less than, but I promise there's so much more than school. You clearly have such a beautiful strong sense of individuality and creativity that most people wish they had and can really never learn. Give yourself a big hug, you got this.",2,ToastMe
Listen you are killing that look! I’m dead ass amazed to see someone looking as good as that!,2,ToastMe
"I don't comment here often but I have to stop and look at you for a while because you're stunning. Your clothes are amazing (love the black-on-black and the choker btw) and your make-up is on point. It's literally better than anything I can try to pull off.  

I'm sorry to hear you have a suicide attempt. As someone with depression and anxiety and sometimes suicidal thoughts, I kind of get it. I'm not saying I understand what you're going through but I know that sometimes life can be terrible and mean to all the wrong people. Please know that it's ok to be sad, disappointed and even angry. They're your beautiful emotions, and the same as love or joy or happy, they should be acknowledged. It's hard, I know, and you may feel like you're fighting a losing battle all by yourself. But I have full confidence you're beyond wonderful and can achieve things in my that I don't even know it's possible and if you think you're alone, please know that there will always be one person out there (aka me) willing to you my full support. 

Love, 

A friend

You want to learn and that is awesome. Please, keep that in mind and don't let other people take that curiosity from you. Ever.

You are truly unique and you in every way it seems, and that is amazing.

Second, college applications suck. It's just a matter of trying again and expanding your net. Try your state-funded schools, they usually have higher caps and easier entrances.
Third, mixers are dope! Go! Have fun! Give a damn what people think when they pay you 100k a year.
Fourth, you're alive. You're enough of a badass that even you can't take you out. Seems like a sign to me.",2,ToastMe

"You do NOT need a degree to succeed. I work in the tech industry where there has been a swing in the last 5+ years regarding college degrees. Lots of tech companies will hire based on demonstrated knowledge and abilities. I have colleagues making well over 6 figures who have only a high school diploma.

If you have any technical aptitude I reccomend heading in that direction. Take on line courses, read free material, practice, contribute to public projects, etc... When you go for interviews point them to the work you have been doing. 

Plus, a lot of tech jobs alllow you to work at home which may help with mental health and workplace anxiety. Good luck.

"It's not pathetic at all. You're a human being reaching out for warmth and affirmation. You deserve love as much as anyone else. Making new friends is very hard and mental health makes things even more difficult. But you are bigger than your disorders and the world needs you in it. You will find your warmth in time but for now, please accept ours.",2,ToastMe
"I’m so impressed by your determination!  It can be so discouraging to not have a college application accepted, but you haven’t let that stop you from trying again.  I once read that grit contributes more to success in life than almost any other factor.   I can’t imagine a better strength to have. 

You’ve got this!  I ended up having to do two years of community college both for cost and due to low high school grades. After my two years of community college, I ended up getting into the school I wanted when I wouldn’t have been about to get in before. 

Also, your eye makeup is impressive. That’s skill!",2,ToastMe
I would be friends with you solely on the basis of your eye makeup.  Looks so cool!,2,ToastMe

I believe in you!!",2,ToastMe
"You are so captivating and your makeup is fire!!!! 

I know how hopeless it can all feel, I was unemployed for a year in a big city with rent and bills to pay. Rejection letters suck. Keep trying to apply but just know college isn’t the only way to succeed. There’s so many other things you can do out there. YouTube channel, etsy business, learn online marketing/SEO for amazon businesses. Honestly the possibilities are endless. Try fiverr! There are so many other jobs out there that we just don’t know about. My friend is looking to become a public notary. You should check it out. You’d have to study and pass the exam, but pays a lot. 

I know it’s tough and sometimes it feels like you can’t hold on any longer. Keep going!!! It truly gets better and we all wanna see you come out on the other side :)",2,ToastMe

"You are so strong and capable. You've survived this long, and that shows your strength. Getting into college is fucking tough and it's not your fault. The fact that you keep trying said a lot about your determination and how much you care about your future. 

I'm sorry to hear that your social circle is so small right now, too. It can be isolating in a city where everyone is there, but trying to pretend they're not. I hope you can find some circles to begin mingling in~ people who share your thoughts on the world. It can be helpful to even just find a weekly group. My boyfriend did bowling for a while, my brother got involved in the Socialist party, and I had a D&D group for a bit. In the meantime, if you need to vent about your frustrations, I hope it's not too awkward to offer myself as a listening ear. 

Life is hard sometimes, and we all feel that pain quietly inside ourselves. I'm sorry you have to go through a period of pain right now, but I'm proud of your resiliency, strength, and determination on the face of all that is hard. Remember that it is okay to feel worry, stress, and anxiety in these times. It is natural. You are doing the right things in the face of it. Feel your feelings, and push forward to a better future.",2,ToastMe

Your only focus is to keep it that way.

Sending love and strength.",2,ToastMe
"First off, you look awesome. Second, college isn’t right for everyone, it can totally be a waste of money and time. BUT, if you ever do decide that college would help you get where you want to go and want some help writing apps, DM me. I would be more than happy to help; I went to college and graduate school and got a ton of help and support from friends and family to get in and stick it though. You don’t need to do things alone.

"I think you know well the feeling that ‘nothing is going to get better, so why stick around?’ Habibti (‘my darling’ in Arabic) - I promise you it can get better - way better. But if you judge your life based on the low points, it’s easy to think that’s all there is to life. I bet you have some memories that you enjoy - a few moments from your past you can think of that made you happy? What then if you judged life based on those moments? I know you can’t see this now, but those few happy memories are the beginning, not the end, of the list of reasons you want to be here with the rest of us. If you don’t stick around, you’ll never know those moments.

If that isn’t enough of a reason, consider the number of complete strangers who have put time into telling you to stay. We don’t know you, but we still stopped to hopefully help. There is kindness in the world - I promise. Please be good to yourself - you are special, you are unique, and you are part of this team - the human team. None of us know what we’re doing, some are just better at faking it than others.

Big hugs - I and many others are a DM away if you want to chat.",2,ToastMe

With a face like yours and an awesome personality that I'm sure you have you can easily make some friends. Making friends as an adult gets harder and harder but put yourself out there. Be brave. Trust me, 99.9% of ppl like meeting new people. Volunteer and go out to random events and bars. Meet new people. Find a hobby then Google search groups that have the same hobby as you. They would be more than glad to have you join them. 
You will find friends! And you will get through this.

Thank you for your pic that reminded me of him. You seem like a very kind person, plus that you’re staying away from your family to protect them speaks volumes about who you are as a person. I know you made this post for a toast but you ended up making my day so much better by reminding me of my stepdad and how wonderful he was and how lucky I was to have him in my life.

Thank you!!,2,ToastMe
"Your beard looks like mine when I have it all trimmed and neat. And I get complemented on it pretty regularly. So I've got a great beard and yours is even better (the little touches of wisdom, as my mom calls them, make it better IMO.)

And your hat is great. I love Bison. And the Rockies.

I hope you get to see your family soon, even if it's a video call or them texting you pictures constantly. I'm sure they miss you just as much as you miss them. I'm sure they are proud of you too, and if they aren't (little kids sometimes don't understand these things... And you look like a dad, you've got that Dad look about your eyes.) they will be once they understand. I'm proud of you.

I'm sorry you have to sacrifice during this. Just please remember the millions of people out there that realize how hard you are working for them and that they are doing their best to make it better for you. The thousands of researchers and techs trying to find treatments and cures. The millions of doctors and nurses struggling day and night to keep this from spreading further and getting worse. The factory workers trying to churn out PPE (masks, gowns, face shields, etc.) Even the people only able to take the advice seriously and stay home to try and keep things spinning. They may not be thinking of you by name and face, but they are doing it for you. We are in this together. It may not feel like it sometimes, but there is a world after this. Different as it may feel when this is all done; this isn't what beats us.

(I hope anyone who is in a similar circumstance gets to read or hear something like this when it gets to be too much. Reach out to your friends, family, and strangers when you can everyone. Send them messages, write things and put them in your window or lawn, send care packages or money to get them care packages, whatever you can to pull them up. We need each other, always but, especially now. If you're the one needing help, reach out. Not everyone can help but keep reaching if you don't find the help right away. Hopelessness gets us nowhere, despair is useless. It's okay to feel those things, but don't let them pull you under. It's cliche but cliches exist for a reason. Just keep moving.)

Stay safe. Stay strong. I'm pulling for you.",2,ToastMe
"Same here, impossible be more tired. Keep up the good work, we can do this!!!! And this will pass eventually. A big hug to you!",2,ToastMe

Another essential employee (although much less essential than you) avoiding family here. My parents are nearing 60 and my grandma moved from out of state to stay with them as she’s facing Alzheimer’s. It really sucks not being able to see them but I have the same fears. Even though it feel awful you’re doing the right thing for them and you deserve a pat on the back for that! It’s hard doing the right thing. Thank you for all you’re doing. I hope after this people continue to value how important truckers are in our lives.

I wish my child's other parent was as concerned. (Has direct contact with high risk patients, confirmed and suspected cases. Barely even washes hands, typically and insists on taking child and themself around others unnecessarily.)

You're doing a great job as a parent and as a hard working person who cares.",2,ToastMe

"You, fine sir, are the reason I feel compelled to keep going, to find the hope in this terrible dark time. I know our government doesn't define our country, but the brave people on the front line do. Every nurse and every doctor at the front line that needs to drive to work counts on you. Every truck shipping medical supplies or baby formula is counting on you. Your family cannot hug you now, but if they could you would be fucking squeezed to death by the amount of love and respect they have for you. Before this pandemic, many people were idolizing toned 6 pack bodies and botox lips, but today I and others are idolizing you and other people keeping our society going. I bow in gratitude to your survice, and you are a light to many of us in these trying times. In this tough time, you are a hero and I hope you can acknowledge that.",2,ToastMe

Keep your head up, call your family every chance you get, and reach out any time you need our encouragement again 💜",2,ToastMe
"You’ve put “essential” in quote marks, like you dot believe it. Why is that? I’ll give you that your remuneration may not reflect what you feel essential workers should receive, and I get that.

What is changing, though, is who we, as tax payers, product consumers, and general members of society, view as essential. We look at Bezos, and Trump, and other fat cat businessmen, and we question their contribution to society. Did they contribute? Did they keep the food on the table, the lights on at home, or the health of their workers forefront of their decision making? No, they did not.

You, on the other hand, did exactly that. You put fuel in the machine which kept the country alive.

You. Are. **Essential**. And we will remember you.",2,ToastMe

Thank you for everything you are doing and the sacrifice of not seeing your family through this. I hope that you are calling them every day so you are getting the support you need.

Just remember, it's okay to feel exhausted, it's okay to feel worn out, those are valid and true experiences.

"Where to begin.....

As an 'essential worker' myself, I understand the tiredness. But I tell myself that if we all stayed home, the world would simply stop. We're running risks and making sacrifices so that others may have a degree of comfort in these trying times. Plus, you know, not being out of work and being able to take care of my household (of one..... lol) is pretty nice too!

As for your family, You are making a massive sacrifice to keep them safe and provided for in these trying times. There is an insane amount of respect in that!

By the power of your majestic beard.... you will endure!",2,ToastMe

"Interesting dichotomy,  self isolating for economic stability, or isolating with family and loved ones during uncertain times. 
That is the ticket right there. 
I will be putting my foot in mouth for being a grump....I was given the paid 4week isolation with family option.... But I would say if you are isolated with no contact and no symptoms for 3 weeks it’s safe to say your prolly good.(not a doctor though). Good luck on the road been there before.",2,ToastMe

"What an awesome dad, and husband. You are selflessly staying away from them now to keep them safe. It has to be gut wrenching to be away from them but you are doing it with such grace. These times are insanely hard for everyone and it would be hard to not be able to see your support system. Keep working hard to support them and this will be over. Soon you will hold them in your arms and tell them how much you missed them. They know you are out there for them and they will be waiting for you when you get back.",2,ToastMe

Dang. That is rough.   Don’t know what to say.  Hang in there.  Karma is a real bitch I do know that.  What goes around comes around.   Good will come to you.  This is a mathematical certainty.  Believe in the good that is out there.  There are good people that love you.  Focus on recovery and your health and wellness.  Serving others helps bring joy too.  God bless you brother.,2,ToastMe

I'm sorry bud. This is tough but I promise you in time you'll be just fine and better off. Try and stay positive. Be strong for your kids. They need you more than ever.,2,ToastMe
What a fake. Your kids will probably come to appreciate how much better you are!,2,ToastMe
"I hope you get through this and recover well from your surgery. Though it might not feel like it at times, I believe whatever is meant to be is meant to be, and vice virsa. I wish you luck and and happiness in the future friend.",2,ToastMe
That’s rough man. You look like a good person and a nice guy. I wish the best for you from here on,2,ToastMe
"You will look back on this soon enough and be so unbelievably proud of yourself. Very soon you’ll be back at home and healing nicely from your surgery. You’ll start to forget about this week, which at the moment is so painful for you. The next time you see the kids, you can cuddle and chat and watch movies and make them laugh and feel so loved and happy. 

Let your ex wife get on with it. Her leaving may just be the best thing that could happen to you. What if in the future you meet THE ONE. The person who you really are meant to be with and share the next part of your life with. A person who would never run off with their boss. A person who is beautiful with your kids and you can all hang out together and have beautiful, happy times. 

Look after your health, take time to rest and heal, look after your kids and put their happiness first... you won’t go wrong. X",2,ToastMe
"hope you’re doing ok man. unfortunately there’s nothing i can say that will make this hurt any less (physically or emotionally), but just know that it won’t hurt so bad forever. like your surgery scars, your heart will heal over time, and your kids will still love you. best of luck",2,ToastMe
Keep your head up my brother. Times are dark right now but at the bottom the only way to go is back up. Take it one day at a time and make a little progress each day.,2,ToastMe

most importantly, be strong; for yourself and your kids l. 

best of luck mate.",2,ToastMe
You're gonna be okay,2,ToastMe
"Good luck with your surgery!! You’re not pathetic at all, you’re human. You’re experiencing some really intense extremes right now so give yourself a break!! You will pull through this and your kids will be waiting for you on the other side. One day at a time, friend.",2,ToastMe
"Weird but I too just had emergency surgery, just got discharged. Stay strong and rest up friend, you deserve to feel some peace",2,ToastMe
"Stay strong,you going to get through this.I believe in you =).",2,ToastMe
"No doubt the situation you are in right now seems insurmountable, and granted, I don’t envy your pain both physical and emotional. With that being said, you did what a good Dad does, you got your kids taken care of first that’s commendable. You made it through a tough surgery and now is your time to focus on getting up on your feet to continue being a great Dad. She lost you brother and she screwed up. It’s her loss. Don’t let her define you because you have to do that for yourself. Divorce is not easy but make sure you have a support system in place, people who you can count on. Forget her man.",2,ToastMe
"That sucks, man. You’ll find someone who sticks by you and remember that your kids love you unconditionally. Surgery is scary and tough and all sorts of things, but you’re already out the other end of it and things are definitely looking up. There will be more time with the kids, don’t let one emergency get ya down.",2,ToastMe
"Stay strong man, we are here for you",2,ToastMe
"I know things are tough right now, but you are going to make it out of this stronger than ever. Be kind to yourself",2,ToastMe
"We love you! And btw, fuck her. You deserve the best!",2,ToastMe
"Wow, I can only try to imagine how this would be like to go through. But that moment in which you sobbed doesn't sound pathetic to me at all after all you've been through, just a normal human reaction after all that happened.  
I wish you all the best, I hope you can recover from your surgery quickly and that you can have a wonderful relationship with your kids :) good luck man!!",2,ToastMe
"You're not alone, just remember that. And you got your kids. You'll make a great recovery and start healing. It all comes with time my guy.",2,ToastMe
"I got you man!
Keep fighting the good fight and I can assure you your kids just want you up and better.",2,ToastMe
"My wife left me for her Professor, lol",2,ToastMe
"You know who really cares when your back is against the wall. Divorced wife or not , she could have come to see you or at least said something. 

You're not alone though. I wish you nothing but the best and usually people like you come out on top. 
I've met a few people that share a similar story like yours and  they usually rise to the occasion. 

I was going to say more but you'll see how this plays out. It'll be great for you, just wait and see. 
I hope you find a better life partner 🙏.",2,ToastMe
"I’m so sorry all of this is happening right now, and you are NOT pathetic. You’ve just been dealt a seriously shitty hand, but you WILL get past this. 
Keep moving forward, one day at a time. Take moments to think on the things you’re grateful for, like your kids. 
You’re going to get through this! Blessings and love to you!",2,ToastMe
"I’m so sorry you’re going through that,

Take your time in grieving,
But also be mindful when it’s time to look at life in the eye and fight for it,

You’re a super dad, fight for your kids, fight for your futures,

I pray you make a speedy recovery not just physically but also emotionally,

You can do it! We’re here for you!!",2,ToastMe
Even at your worst time clearly you are a good looking guy. Someone else's behaviour is reflective of them not you so long as you are basically a decent person which I'm sure you are. Wish you all the best. 1,2,ToastMe
"The important thing is that you survived bro.  And you will continue to survive.  Trust me, I’ve been there.  In 2013 my wife of 13 years decided that till death do us part didn’t really mean that.  It broke my heart at the time as she was the woman I planned to spend the rest of my life with.  Some seven years later I’m glad she made the decision, as I wouldn’t want to be married to someone who didn’t take their vows seriously.  It hurts like hell right now, and I’m sorry.  But you will get through this and you will grow your relationship with your kids.   Just keep putting one foot in front of the other, and know that there are people out there wishing you the best.",2,ToastMe

Oh I'm so sorry this happened on ur visit week with kids. They will understand. Ur wife sounds like a nasty bad egg. Let's toast to future. And good health. Ur wealth is ur health xxx,2,ToastMe
I'm sorry. I don't have anything to say cause I don't know or can't imagine the pain you are in. I only wish good things happen to you. Do good karma and the universe will do good to you. Please be strong and survive.,2,ToastMe
"Hey bud, this sucks. Nothing any of us say is going to make it feel okay right now, but you’ll get through this. 

What I can say is you still look young, you’re a good looking guy, and you still have a future. You have dodged some future pain by spending your time with someone who didn’t deserve you. And while nice guys may not finish first, they tend to live happily ever after, so just hang on.

Now is the time to learn how to be an even better dad, to figure out who you are on your own, and to follow your own passions. And should you decide you want a relationship again, I’m sure you’ll find a great woman values a man who is a great father, a man who knows who he is, and who lives passionately. 

So I’m metaphorically toasting to your future. All the best!",2,ToastMe
"That sucks, I had similar experiences,  you can survive this!  Cancel any joint bank accounts and credit cards.....
You survived surgery, God has a plan, you survived!
You are a survivor and your kids need their real father!  You can do this!",2,ToastMe
"Lift your head my brother! Things will get better for you, I'm sure. We all go through problems in our lives and you can be sure that I know very well the darkness that must be going through your head.  

Don't give up on happiness, because it will come back, I promise.",2,ToastMe
"You’re going to get through this bro, and you’re going to be hugging your kids tomorrow. Single best medicine during times like this is time. You’re at the trough of the wave. It’s only going to get better from here. I wish you a speedy recovery bro! Fuck her.",2,ToastMe

You might have to learn to be selfish again but the most important thing in life is you. Love and accept yourself and things you can’t control and work on the things you can.",2,ToastMe
"From observations, I doubt your soon to be ex wifes relationship with her boss will be long term.  Cheating is fun and exciting with a hint of danger of being discovered and once the relationship is in the open, one or both parties will discover thier partner has faults. If it lasts past that, they will be miserable because each know the other is capable of cheating and they will not trust one another. Get well, take one day at a time and know your integrity and honor is intact.",2,ToastMe
"You rock! And if others don’t, then it’s only natural that you feel lonely, the best people also do when on the wrong environment. You will find better people soon!",2,ToastMe
Believe in yourself. You are much stronger than you think. Now it's time for you to shine. You will. Just believe in yourself.💯,2,ToastMe
"This absolutely sucks! You are very fortunate to have found someone quickly to watch the kids as anything like this with your intestines can turn ugly very quickly (think peritonitis and/or sepsis). I am very glad that you didn’t try to tough it out. There will be other turns with your kids, but they only have one Dad, so I am glad you are safe. Don’t worry about asking for your ex during the drug induced fog that surrounds surgery like this. I have been called many names and heard many wild things when people have just come out of surgery, some nice and a lot not so nice. Your ex was a big part of your life so it is natural for you to ask for her. She, however, is acting like a reprehensible human being and right now you are better off not dealing with her. Focus on getting better. Don’t push to have your diet changed until they say you are ready. Walk. Take the pain meds you need to be able to rest. Walk. Ask the nurses to help you make visits with your kids special (we love doing that). Walk. Use your incentive spirometer (ask if you haven’t been given one) as it is important that you don’t get atelectasis pneumonia from not breathing deeply  enough post belly surgery. Did I mention “walk”? Hope you get through this emergency with as little pain as possible and no complications. PS. Don’t bend over in a hospital gown, they don’t fit anyone well enough to cover everything. Best wishes.",2,ToastMe
Hair is looking pretty damn good for being in the hospital,2,ToastMe
"I’m so sorry this all happened so suddenly. But she lost out, really. She’s gonna regret it soon but you’ll have moved on to bigger and better things. Bet your kids love you too, you seem like someone who would really care for them like a real dad should.",2,ToastMe
"You're the most I-need-a-hug person I've ever seen. I'm so sorry this has all rained down on you like this. In spite of your physical condition and pain, you look like a sweet, lovely guy. We have all had our hearts busted at least once. It sucks, but usually, we go on to find someone else who will love us and respect us. I don't mean to be clichéd. but really, one door closes, and another opens. This is a time for you to heal your body and your heart. Don't rush into your next relationship until you have a handle on yourself. If you ever need someone to talk to, feel free to DM. Virtual bear hugs to you, Reddit-friend.",2,ToastMe

"Remember to breathe my good sir! i know its a trying time but with your intestines all tensed up and twisted it sounds like youre going through a LOT of anixety.. when we're talking about stressful stuff or dealing with stressful things our bodies react even if we dont know its happening. be sure to ground yourself daily. start or end your day with something you can be positive about. it doesnt have to be much but you have to be your own wife for a while lol.

BE NICE TO YOURSELF!! YOU ARE NOT TRASH AND YOU ARE NOT FORGOTTEN YOU ARE A DIVORCED MAN WITH KIDS WHO SHOULD BE PROUD OF HIMSELF. because if youre not proud of yourself who else is going to be proud of you.

ive also found it really helpful to think of the person you were as a kid and really try to help them.  you know all of the problems theyve faced and you know all their hopes and dreams.  now that youre an adult with adult-abilities you can do something about those hopes and dreams.

and above all else please get counseling, talk to someone, talk to a professional who knows what youre going through. its something you dont realize is important until youre in the thick of it. Talking to someone is the most therapeutic when you have no outlet.",2,ToastMe
So sorry to hear about the turn of events :( hopefully you’re recovering well and that your kids are keeping you company. You seem like a genuine soul who’s had some bad luck. I know better things are coming your way. Chin up!!! We’re here for you!!,2,ToastMe
"Even sick, you're super cute. If I was single and nearby, I would hold your hand.",2,ToastMe
Hi. Prolly will get lost in the tons of messages you get but my advice is this. You take your slice of life and isolate it from hers. Don’t compare this to that. You take that slice of life you have and you focus on making it beautiful and start taking care of it without the distractions of how others are living theirs. You nourish it with the things you need for a solid foundation. Focus on your career and then time for your children. When your slice of the cake becomes more beautiful and fruitful more good people will come to you as your slice of the cake becomes a whole cake.,2,ToastMe

"It is the first time ever that I post a comment here... but I needed to tell you, to assure you, that you will be happy again and this all will pass.  And yes, you will be a different person but probably a a happier one too!

After 23 years of marriage, my ex-husband left me suddenly (for me it was sudden!) via SMS for a girl our kids' age.  At the same time we were moving countries, my kids were moving out of the house and our dog passed away.  There were so many losses at once, I thought I was not going to survive it!  There were moments of the most profound despair... I almost didn't believe in life anymore... but I never gave up, I pushed it thru for my kids and my grandkids that were just arriving as my world was devastated... I took one day at a time...

Slowly I found a new life for myself, and I can tell you that I am very happy now.  I moved back to my home country and I fulfilled my dream of having my own business. And, even though right after the divorce I was absolutely sure I was going to die alone, I found a new love and I have  been dating the most wonderful man and very much in love.

So, even if at this very moment it does not feel like it, you will be very happy again... So believe in it, this too shall pass.",2,ToastMe
"Sweet thing, don't you fret.  She left not because you are less than.  Her feelings changed and you are still as great as you were before you had her.  You've got wonderful kids to look forward to spending time with when you're right as rain.  Your kids will know why this happened and bounce back.  And as for the surgery well that is just bad timing.  And now it is done farting on your schedule.  A fleeting moment of weakness is just that: a moment.  Let yourself have moments of weak and vulnerable and learn from them and stride forwards on to better things.  They're coming.",2,ToastMe

"Being scared is not pathetic! Hospitals are scary, surgery is scary, being alone is scary. 

The last time I had to have a surgery with full anesthesia I was close to either tears or screaming and running away when they wheeled me into the OR. The staff was great. A young student held my hand and the anesthesiologist was really funny and this was the only thing keeping me from dissolving into a blubbering wreck because I felt so powerless. Keep in mind, this was a planned and rather minor surgery - yours was an emergency which makes everything so much scarier. 

It sucks that you lost your time with your kids, but concentrate on getting well now. I'm sure your kids understand and I hope they weren't/aren't too scared. 

Regarding your general situation: You're good-looking now (even though you're tired, sad, and recovering from freaking surgery) - which means you are a real looker once life gives you a break. 

I wish you all the best. Things will get better! This internet stranger is sending hugs.",2,ToastMe
"I really feel for you. You have to hold on tight right now and remember that these dark days are going to pass. You are going to look back one day and realize that all this pain needed to happen in order for you to get to where you really need to be. Be there for your kids, don't talk crap about mom to the kids, give your kids security, stability and routine. This is going to turn out for the better. You will see better days, my friend!",2,ToastMe
You look like a tv show dad who everyone loves,2,ToastMe
"I know you probably won’t see this, but I hope your surgery went well with no complications. I’m glad you still get to see your kids. If your ex-wife left you for her boss then you were way too good for her anyways.",2,ToastMe
"I'm not reading the comments besides your comment at the top so this has probably all been said by others already.

1.  Not diminishing how much this situation hurts/sucks at all with the following.

2.  Time makes everything better, theres not much you can do but fake it till you make it.  Go to work, do what you have to do, then just die on the couch.  Take some time to be really fucking down and then when you have the kids again maybe you'll feel a little better.

3. Don't think of all the time together as gone.  None of it is gone.  You shared your life with someone you wanted to share it with and all of that stuff happened and isn't a waste just because its over now.

4. Be a good example for your kids.  Show them the best ways to be about everything.  Do not be a martyr/victim.

5. Take time to see who you are now.  There may be a lot of things you got stuck being like because you were with someone that knew you ten years ago and maybe felt like you couldn't just suddenly have totally different opinions or likes/dislikes.

6.  If you do want to find someone else to be in a serious relationship with it will happen and it will probably be just as good or better than your previous one.  Don't force it or panic to ""nab"" someone because you're getting older.

7.  Don't take advice from random people on the internet, just use it as a thought-starter.  See a professional therapist to help you deal with the trauma of this situation so that you and your kids are healthy mentally.

8.  GET RIPPED DUDE.  Seriously, this is a bad time to tell you to go to the gym with the whole virus crap but start exercising immediately at home and go to a gym as soon as things are open again.  Regular exercise helps so much.  Don't think ""yeah he's right I should"", download an app when you have recovered from your surgery and get to it ASAP.

9.  The fact that you posted this and asked for support tells me you are probably a super nice guy and a good person so just because one person out of billions decided they didn't want your around any more doesn't mean SHIT. Find good people for you, they are out there.",2,ToastMe
"Probably got enough advice from everyone already, but you got this man. I was in your shoes 2 years ago, just stay strong and focus on the important things, your kids and yourself. Spend as much time with them as you can on your time with them, the on the ""off"" ( you're never really off of dad duty) weeks that's when you double down on self care and improvement, for yourself and for them. There are gonna be some really LOW lows and some fantastic highs, just take it all one step at a time. Kings build up Kings.",2,ToastMe
"Let me tell you a story. Maybe it will help. When I was 16 years old I met a girl on Myspace. Yes Myspace. We spoke to each other every night until almost 3am sometimes later for years. I skipped prom, homecoming, dates and pretty much everything that had anything to do with other women. I knew she was the one for me without a doubt. After about 6 years I turned 21 and decided for my birthday I was going to fly to her and finally meet her(she lived across the country) I was so nervous, we met and it was like we just continued to fall even more in love. She was everything I thought she would be and more. Fast forward a year and we had our first child together. Still in love at this point life had it's curves but we stayed happy. Fast forward 3 more years and oneday after I picked her up from work ""we needed to talk"" I was again nervous because I had been feeling like we had been very distant at that point in our relationship. I stopped her and said ""I don't care what you've done I want to make it work"" she replied "" I don't, I've been cheating on you for almost a year (with exactly who I assumed it would be). After this moment I fucking spiralled into the dark abyss. I was hooked on acid I spent nights alone doing nothing because the thought alone made me sick to my stomach. I wasn't able to see my son. So many problems. Then oneday I realized I would work on my craft. I had been a rapper since I was nine years old. I was a fat white kid being bullied constantly you know. I studied and I studied and I practiced more and more every single day, after almost 20 years of rapping I'm gaining more and more fans across the world every day. My latest album is streamed on Spotify in over 23 countries I'm no celebrity but I have been ""recognized"" a couple times and even been asked for an autograph or two. I told you all of that to say this. It may seem unbearable at times but from all of the pain things you never thought were possible could happen. You are important, you are loved and you can do this. Keep your head up homie. You never know how life will change when the scars heal. Without her cheating none of this would have happened to me. I had already made the decision to quit music and focus on our life together when I met her. Also I met another girl 3 years ago who loves the shit out of me and supports my music career. She's at every show.",2,ToastMe
Breaks my heart to read. I wish you the best of luck with everything. You truly deserve it. I hope your health just gets better from here. Don’t get too down about missing your first week with the kids. You have the rest of your life to love on them and be with them. Good luck to you. Sending all the positive energy your way!!,2,ToastMe
"She's a real bitch! If I were rich, I'd help you out",2,ToastMe

"Wow! ...just wow, firstly, you’re incredibly strong will get through all of this and be better for it in the long run!

I’m sure none of what happened is through any fault of your own, sometimes things like this just happen at the worst possible time at all that matters now is your recovery and journey back to health. Your ex wife is clearly your ex for a reason, if she doesn’t want to support someone that she once loved and is the father of her children then that says a lot about her and very little about you. Her reaction towards you likely has nothing to do with you personally, it’s directed at the person or idea of you that she’s created in her head. 

As for your kids, I’m sure they’re going to understand why it had to happen like this, even if they aren’t old enough yet they eventually will understand. All you can do right now is try and recover for your kids! It was an unfortunate circumstance that most likely couldn’t have been avoided but the best thing you can do not is try to learn from the situation and use the recovery period to self reflect and improve so you can be the bigger person in this scenario. 

The simple fact you reached out for help at all in a time of vulnerability shows a great deal of self awareness and takes courage and strength, be proud of yourself, you will be a great role model for your kids. I hope you are recovering well and things are starting to improve soon!",2,ToastMe
I’m so sorry friend. You will get through this. Sometimes things get really bad but better times await you ahead.,2,ToastMe
You’re clearly going through a rough patch. Things will get better! And you’re very cute so I don’t doubt you’ll find someone better in the future :) you got this & I hope you’re recovering well from your surgery.

In our old house we could see you guys coming down or long driveway. Gave us plenty of time to offer up a Christmas goodie bag of baked goods (not all always accepted, which is understandable. You know, that whole stranger danger thing). Always have some coffee, can of soda if they wanted. Here, I felt horrible because we just moved and just weren’t ready for this holiday.

"When I was five my mom left me home alone for a few hours, came home drunker than hell and passed out on the couch. I couldn’t wake her up and I thought she had died. She went to every single school event shitfaced. I found her in the bathroom, on more than a couple occasions, bleeding all over after having cut her wrists. Having to stick my fingers down her throat to have her vomit up pills she’d swallowed far too many of. 

She doesn’t do so many life threatening stunts like that anymore but she never shook the drugs and alcohol. I honestly don’t have any hope she will ever change. All I ever did was hope that she’d want to change but all she’s ever done is prove that she never will.",2,ToastMe
You’re an amazing dad. Many people wouldn’t do this for their kids,2,ToastMe
I like your mustache,2,ToastMe
Big respect. Keep going brother🔥🔥🔥,2,ToastMe
"Congrats on the second chance, every day my dude. 

Enjoy it!",2,ToastMe
That shit is the fucking devil. I honestly believe it's evil and I'm not even remotely religious. It's taken quite a few of my friends and I hate it with a passion. Watching people I love ruin or end their lives with it is so painful but not nearly as painful as living it. I'm really fucking proud of you internet stranger. Most people never make it back and I have an idea of how miserable it was for you so fuck yes good job. Your boys got to see what strength and love really look like.,2,ToastMe

"This same exact thing happened with my uncle he overdosed twice. His girlfriend brought him back the first time and then his son brought him back a sending time. After his entire life of doing drugs and in and out of jail he is finally out of jail and back home! Also made them a promise to never touch it again. He also became a counselor as well for people who are struggling with addiction. I’m actually going to [link you his book he made about his life as a drug addict and his struggles](https://www.amazon.com/AMAZING-TRAGIC-JEFFREY-BOVEE/dp/173158489X/ref=nodl_). The novel can be difficult to read at times but it really shows the worst of drug addict and might help you understand why people go through those things and how to get past it and the relief you feel once you fine with it. So good luck in the future, and good job quitting, I’m proud of you!

"Oh my gosh, that sounds exhausting and depressing to not only have to try and rebuild mental health while stuck in an environment with the ex, but battle an ED and process your friend’s death.  I really hope you are doing teeny tiny actions to help care for yourself and I’m very proud of you for what you’ve accomplished in the middle of some very tough experiences. No matter how you feel, you ARE doing great and as you keep slogging forward, it will lighten and adjust for better and better health, circumstances, and eventually, joy.

For what it is worth, when I haven’t been able to go to a therapist, the app Youper has been a life saver to help me clear my own thoughts and process a bit. It’s no replacement but it helps.

Lastly, you have one of the prettiest face shapes I think I’ve ever seen—your bone structure is incredible. You look like you would be a perfect person to model for a character design of an elf/fairy/Disney Princess.  Sending love and hugs.",2,ToastMe

No matter how much shit hits the fan, I can tell that you will be able to truck on. Try to remember that this is just one stage in a life that will be 4 times as long as what you have already experienced. You still have an incredible amount of people to meet, joys to experience and laughs to have. You are going to be okay and I believe in you! Are you getting professional assistance for your ED? If not You really should seek it out, and i recommend getting some therapy for the aftermath of your relationship regardless. It’s okay to not be 100% all the time, and you, as much as anyone deserve all the support and help you can need ❤️ Best wishes and best of luck! Lots of love from Norway",2,ToastMe
But yet you smile 😭 sending you love and appreciation. Things are fucked right now but someday soon you will experience the relief to remind you of the good in life. Please feel free to DM me for a listening ear and some cool grounding techniques o swear by!,2,ToastMe

People who ghost are cowards and you’re super cute! A toast to you for having the courage to leave that relationship and stay strong through everything.,2,ToastMe
Honestly I really dont understand how anyone could ghost you on dates.,2,ToastMe
"Okay. You are a straight champion. You've slogged through all that? And you're still any measure of functional? You're legitimately faring better than I am.

Truly, a toast to you.

Stay the real you when dating, btw. It's crucial. There are so many people out there, your odds of finding someone are better that the last generation's — though the time to success may be longer. These things relate in that if people pass on that date, they clearly were never right for you, but unwilling to be cool about it. So, when someone does stick around, it will be because they liked YOU. You deserve better, and you deserve that kind of good.",2,ToastMe
Your skin looks perfect and you’re so unbelievably naturally beautiful. I’d give anything to have your complexion. Keep fighting! You’re amazing.,2,ToastMe
"You’re so strong, with all of those things coming at you. Things will definitely go uphill. You’re gorgeous, continue holding your head up high and fighting even if it’s hard and it seems like no end is in sight.",2,ToastMe
"You are a really strong person and I know if you were able to get through it all, you can still keep going. It may have been a really tough journey, but I know if you keep going, many good things will come to you. If you ever need a friend, you can chat with me in a PM",2,ToastMe
You are cute. Eat healthy food. I am also lonely.,2,ToastMe
You have so much kindness in your eyes and you are so so so deserving of love. You should be so proud of yourself for making it out and into this new beginning (and even if you aren't I be proud for you),2,ToastMe
"there's not much else I can say that others haven't already, but just know that people more often ghost because they're scared, themselves, and it's no reflection on you. You're gorgeous and cute. You've been through a lot of bad shit, but you'll come out on top. Stronger. Better.

I would absolutely go on a date with you if I was in a position to, however without knowing you I would caution against dating others while you're still healing from an abusive relationship. If you're in a position to get a therapist (if you're at a university, they likely have free resources), I'd highly recommend trying it out.

Much love, you're worth it and you have all the power and resources to be better than anyone else ever was to you.",2,ToastMe
You seem lovely.,2,ToastMe
"im glad you were able to get out of that relationship alright, i hope you also have a speedy recovery :(( you look amazing btw. anyone who ghosts you is a dickhead and doesnt know what theyre missing out on",2,ToastMe
You deserve internet bear hugs.  *bear hugs for you*,2,ToastMe
"I am not good with words, but I wanted to write something for I felt love for you. I hope you have the courage to go through these tough times, and still be the kind and loving person you are. Take your time and transform yourself into a better version of you with this experience. It must feel very scary right now, but trust me you have already taken the most difficult step by ending the relationship. Everything will fall into place in some time. You look very pretty and I feel bad for those guys that they didn't get a chance to get to know you. If you ever feel lonely, feel free to DM me. You are not alone.",2,ToastMe
"Good for you getting away from a abusive relationship. Not many have that courage to go because they love their partner too much.
Getting ghosted is the worst feeling ever.
I really hope you are doing better now. I understand how you feel",2,ToastMe
Best wishes and I hope things get better for you soon.  Good for you for posting this and letting people see you.,2,ToastMe
I'm not sure why this was recommended to me but I wanted to say something nice to help you through the holidays. You're beautiful. I'm going through some shit to but it's just holiday depression but if you want to talk it'd help me out by not feeling alone and I can feel good about helping someone else out.,2,ToastMe
"Well aren’t you a strong bad ass!!! So proud of you building up the courage to leave! Don’t worry about being ghosted, give yourself
Some time! You are SOOOO pretty too! 😍😍🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰 Those cheeks!! Leave me a message if you ever want someone to just talk at you and fake rant about stuff in a really NY accent that tends to make my friends laugh even through text 💜",2,ToastMe
"Hello there, sending you good vibes and warm hugs and loving prayers from Texas!! 

So proud of you for ending that relationship. I know that’s hard but seriously, GO YOU for making it happen! You’re such a rockstar!! It takes a lot of mental fortitude to leave your comfort zone for something that you know is good for you. 

As far as the ghosting - I’m just sorry that happened, and that there are cowardly people in the world. It just means they aren’t brave enough to communicate clearly like an adult (which also means you’re dodging some lame relationships). 

I notice you have your own company up in Seattle - my company’s HQ is actually in Seattle, and so I’m up there every now and then. Feel free to PM me if you’d like a friend / pen pal :) I love meeting new friends!!",2,ToastMe
"You don't know how ridiculously happy I am for you that you got yourself out of that relationship. I know that life is hard right now, but I really believe that everyone is strong enough to get through whatever life throws at them.

You look like a lovely person, and someone will be very lucky to NOT ghost you.",2,ToastMe
"You're doing a great job of hanging in there! You are really pretty and have such kind eyes. 

Honestly the dating thing is a drama. Focus on your relationship with yourself - you're the best friend you'll ever have.",2,ToastMe
"So sorry to hear about your friend, just remember you don't have to go that route yourself.   Your a very attractive girl and anyone who ghost you is missing out on a wonderful person.  The eating disorder i suspect has resurfaced because of stress.  Find a support group for the eating disorder and they can definitely help you.  See your dr if you have one, professional help if possible.  And just remember,  even if you are lonely you don't have to go back to that toxic abusive relationship to be happy, happiness will find you if you seek out happy supportive people.  Good luck pretty girl.",2,ToastMe
"Hey this may be TMI, but I feel stuck in an abusive relationship right now. Im 31 and a dude, but it is something Ive never experienced before and it has riddled me with anxiety and struggling with my self esteem. My friends have really had to help me see that a relationship can be verbally and emotionally abusive without physical abuse.

Im still trying to find the courage to leave and your post helped me. Proud of you for getting out and getting on with life.",2,ToastMe
"I don't think people understand just how difficult it really is to leave an abusive relationship unless you've personally experienced it. As a fellow survivor, you need to know I'm so so SO proud of you. It takes a hell of a lot of strength to do what you did. You matter. Now and always.",2,ToastMe
You have kind eyes,2,ToastMe
"So sorry to hear that love, mental health is a daily struggle for some of us.",2,ToastMe
"This is crazy that this came across my feed, but I was in a play with you in real life like 5 or so years ago. (You can PM me for proof if you like, I don't want to blast personal info about either of us here.) I just want you to know I thought you were incredibly cool then and I still think you're really awesome. I'm very proud of the things you've done, including leaving an abuser. That takes a ton of guts. As someone with a long history of self harm who's also lost friends to suicide, I'm really sorry to hear about the stuff going on right now. I really admire your spirit, and I'm always around to chat if you ever need an ear. You are beautiful, bright, talented, and fun.",2,ToastMe
You are stunning. Let the missed dates go and focus on being the best you for now. Look ahead to the happy future in store for you.,2,ToastMe
Good luck recovering. You’ll get there :),2,ToastMe
You are very pretty!!  And I’m sorry what you went through.  But please understand that people who abuse others are very insecure and have issues with themselves and are extremely unhappy.  It’s not you at all.  I truly hope that you can find a great person to be in a passionate relationship together.  It would also be great to have a nice family too someday.,2,ToastMe
I am so sorry you’ve had to go through this shit! You’re gorgeous and I bet the only reason you’ve been ghosted is because they’re intimidated by your good looks :) I hope you can get feeling better!,2,ToastMe
"You’re going to be great! You made an incredibly hard choice, and are now creating your better self. Don’t look back at old coping mechanism (eating disorder) look forward to the amazing person you can be.",2,ToastMe
"You’re so freaking cute, why you always lying. No seriously, you’re gorgeous.",2,ToastMe
Focus on yourself beautiful.,2,ToastMe
Just want to send you a hug and a smile. You  are doing well. Xx,2,ToastMe
"Wow i could hardly believe anyone would ghost you on a date, you are drop dead gorgeous.",2,ToastMe
"Its good you had the strength to get out of a bad relationship that wasnt doing you no good. Dont worry on the dates keep trying, there are alot of selfish assholes in this world but in the dirt you will find the good ones.  Keep trying you will eventually learn how to weed out the bad people from the start.  Ive been there after a really bad breakup also and the loneliness killed me. THe best thing is to fill up your time. Go take dance lessons, take a class you always wanted, take that trip or visit to that museum you wanted to go. Whatever your interestss might be use them to find activities to keep yourself busy. I was interested in astronomy and ended up finding adult seminars at the local observatory. I ended up finding groups of people who were similar to me and starting to get together with them. BE strong, time is the only way to heal so be patient. P.S. if i lived near you i would totally take you out on a wonderful date",2,ToastMe
I’d go get a slice of pizza with you any day of the week.,2,ToastMe

Hi! We are seriously going through some very very similar stuff so please feel free to send a DM if you wanna talk! You seem super lovely and resilient and I’m sorry I can’t tell you why these things are happening but I can tell you that you deserve love and peace.,2,ToastMe
Seems like life roasted you good enough that you don’t need us.. well done for staying strong..,2,ToastMe
Ugogurl,2,ToastMe
You've got one of the kindest smiles I've seen in a while. It made me happy so just look in the mirror :)  We all get ghosted all the time. This is life nowadays. You get used to it. Think of them as shitty job interviews you get to avoid. Might take a bit but you'll land on your feet. One day things will just work itself out and life will be lovely. Get the help you need and talk to friends. If you need a quick happy boost feel free to reach out.,2,ToastMe
"I hope you can get better and be happy, everyone deserves to be happy",2,ToastMe
You’re bloody gorgeous! I can’t believe someone would ghost you!,2,ToastMe
"Huge respect for overcoming that abusive relationship and although not related to the text, your eyes look lovely. <3
Good luck out there dude, You have my support.",2,ToastMe
If you need someone to talk to I’m here,2,ToastMe
"First off: I admire your courage!! Leaving an abusive relationship takes so so much strength and you can be proud of yourself!

About dating... Please please please try and not take ghosting as something that's wrong with you! Ghosting is about the other person and their lack of communication skills - it is something egotistical and says nothing about the other person or their worth!!

I know it's hard and it hurts but those people are just immature and don't care about who they hurt by their behavior!

I've been ghosted numerous times, once even by a guy I've been dating for months! He simply didn't have the courage or respect towards me to break up with me directly. He basically was a coward and nothing else!

Please just take a step back from dating and give yourself the love and attention you're seeking from other people. Let yourself heal for now and treat yourself with kindness, because you deserve it! 

You're such a lovely and strong woman and you deserve to be treated with kindness and you deserve love. But it has to start with yourself.

You deserve to be happy and if I've learnt one thing it's that It's so important to realize that the one person you should be getting that from first and foremost is yourself!

I can't even begin to imagine how hard it must've been to lose your best friend on top of all that have happened. I'm really sorry for your loss! 

But I believe you're strong enough to work through all of this and come out an even stronger person than you already are.

Keep that beautiful smile up and if you ever need to talk to someone feel free to PM me!",2,ToastMe
Im a sucker for a cute smile and rosy cheeks and you have both :),2,ToastMe
"I believe in you. You managed to leave this relationship for your own sake and I'm proud of you for it. 
It is going to be hard but you are strong. You can get though it. Do not be affraid to ask  for help either. And know it's okay to feel down sometimes, you are allowed to cry and rest because it has been difficult for you.
I wish I could give you a hug and hang out with you.
I also want to add that you are gorgeous! 

You can be my friend if you want to. :)",2,ToastMe
You look like Linda Cardellini. Hawkeye’s wife in the Marvel movies. Which is a big compliment; I think she’s very attractive.,2,ToastMe
"I am extremely proud of you for being able to get out of an abusive relationship. You are way to valuable to be treated like that.

I am so sorry about your best friend, as some one who lost a family member to Suicide, I know that pain is never easy, so try to stay strong but also know it’s ok to have days were you just need to be sad or angry or scared etc.

You are  beautiful young person and there is a bright future ahead of you",2,ToastMe
Someday I hope to see those sad eyes show joy and hope. You’ll get there. It is a journey. Not a destination. These people who are ghosting you? Change apps or go sit at a bar or coffee shop and make some eye contact. You’ll find someone to talk to and hang out with VERY soon. Good luck.,2,ToastMe
"You are beautiful and you look like being kind. All you need is someone who tries to make your life better. That won't change the past, but that will be a good start.",2,ToastMe
"I lost my best friend this same time last year to the same thing. The emotions that follow are so difficult to navigate. You’re a badass. Keep it up.

Edit: oh and you a cutie. Don’t mind them people ghosting. You’ll find what you’re looking for.",2,ToastMe
"You deserve the best.  I’m sorry it hadn’t shown up yet.  When it does this will make for one hell of a contrast.  You are worth it, wonderful, and loved. Nothing changes that.",2,ToastMe
"You are such a brave soul, I believe in you. You are never alone, we are all here for you!",2,ToastMe

"Been in an abusive relationship before, it is not fun. Getting out of it was hard enough because of all the toxicity I had to cure myself of with time.

"You look like a really nice person, someone I would like to have a coffee with and just chat for a few hours. You are a natural beauty. 

I am sorry that you have already experienced so much pain in your young life. I have experienced a lot of pain myself when I was your age, struggling from addiction and depression. But one day the sun will also shine bright in your life too. It might take some time and patience. But I believe if you believe in yourself and don't give up hope that things will turn to the better. 

I wish you a happy holiday season. /hug",2,ToastMe

"You’re beautiful and you didn’t deserve what life threw at you. 

I was in your situation (found my friend who committed suicide, it’ll be 11 years tomorrow) and I’ve been out of a horrifically abusive relationship for 2 years now. 

I’m not going to lie it’s not easy and especially missing your friend will never stop. 
However, things will be brighter. 
Look how incredibly strong you are. Look at all the things you’ve been through and yet you’re still going. 

I know how cliche that sounds but it’s true - it’s always darkest before the dawn. Things might feel terrible right now but I promise you, you will be okay. 
You’re a survivor and all the things you have been through are making you a stronger person. 
You will be thriving and I hope loads of wonderful things are coming your way. 

Look at it like we look at the seasons. It was winter solstice yesterday, which means every day will be a little bit brighter, but by bit. You might not immediately see a difference but if you look back in 3 months time you see how bright things are compared to what they are now. 
I believe it is the same with our lives as well. I truly hope that soon you will look back and you will realise that things have improved. 

You are so loved and more importantly, you are worthy of love. 

If you need to talk, send me a message. 

Sending you internet hugs 💕",2,ToastMe

I hope you’re getting help for your eating disorder, but if you aren’t, try reaching out to someone. I know that’s hard, but you’ll be glad you did. 
I also hope all these kind words from reddit peeps has made you feel less lonely, they’re amazing folk and I’m sure any one of them (myself included) would be happy to get another virtual friend. I know it’s not ideal, but we’re all here for you.",2,ToastMe

You’re a hell of a lot prettier than most people out there! I can’t imagine what you’re going through but know that you’re amazing. 

I’m so sorry about your friend. That’s terrible and so hard to take in but you will get past it. Life always gets better even though it seems like it never could. I’ve been in your shoes and I’m so glad that I’m still here to enjoy life, even though at this moment it’s terrible.",2,ToastMe

you are incredibly strong to have survived 3 years in an abusive relationship and without your best friend for a year. i am so sorry for your loss. i don’t know much about EDs but if they’re anything like mental health illnesses, you are strong from facing it day in and day out

you must be very brave and courageous. you have put yourself out there in the dating scene multiple times despite the ghosting. you freed yourself from an unhealthy relationship. you put your image on the internet for strangers. you admitted you feel sad and alone to said strangers. i don’t know many people who can acknowledge that at all

being alone sucks. but i think that something is keeping people who aren’t good for you out of your life so that there’s plenty of room for people who are good for you. and i hope they come soon so that you can bless their lives with your existence",2,ToastMe

"You are absolutely beautiful, first off. Ghosting is a shitty tactic, but remember it could be a lot of reasons, most likely not even related to you. 

One of the best things I've learned in life with my own anxiety is this : ""You are not important to most people.""

It sounds harsh, but let me break it down. If you are anything like me, you constantly worry about what others are thinking based on actions like being ghosted or having a perceived ackward moment for example. 

It's maddening sometimes to wonder if u offended someone, am I good enough, was I not attractive enough. 

But honestly, it's generally innocuous reasons and most people are living their own lives and not thinking too much about anyone but themselves.  The trick is to find someone who fits you and your world view and who can communicate honest and openly. Then you won't have to be anxious about all the things you think are left unsaid. 

This may seem rambling, itt a bit of a hard concept to get across in a text post, but I hope it helps. 

There's also nothing wrong with being introverted. Maybe check out your local board game store for some nights where people play games. It's a great way to meet people and usually very low stress.",2,ToastMe

It’s okay to grieve. It’s okay to feel like crap. The eating disorder you overcame beginning to return, the loneliness, the trash men ghosting in and out, it’s all part of a transition, it’s temporary, and the person at the end may change but will be only stronger, more independent.

Also with regards to the suicide - talk about it. To anyone that's willing to listen, until you have processed. Even then there will be days where you will miss him/her, and that's just how it is. Personally the day I felt the most sad about my fathers suicide was half a decade later when I stood in a situation I really wanted him to be there for. It's gonna suck sometimes, but always turn it upside down and think that you miss a person because they were awesome, and remember them for that.

If you're not interested just say so, we're all adults here. If I was you I'd look into taking some kind of class or something like yoga. It really does great things for the soul and you could meet new people.  


Stay strong though, all of this will pass!",2,ToastMe
"It sounds like this is just not your time, at all. Or at least this is not your good time. But some of this at least can be reframed a little. Because there is a lot to toast.
You have found the strength to leave a situation that was terrible. There are many who would crave your strength and bravery and many who never find it. Well done.
It will take some time to shake the pain and vulnerability that is left, this may put off some people who are looking for a casual hook up, they could be bad for you anyway, so the ghosting may actually be a bonus. Well done for trying and getting conversations to that point in the first place, that shows resilience.
You show awareness of your own self to know about the eating disorder and name it as such. You are in a fight, against many foes, but you are still fighting and you are winning. Keep that up, you are doing great!
That’s shit, so shit, for you, your friend and all who have lost. Nothing can take that pain away from this moment, but it will go. It will leave you and leave you with your strength and the kindness that pours past the sadness in your eyes. You will live for greater moments and happiness will find you and you it.

When you walk through a storm, hold your head up high and don’t be afraid of the dark. At the end of the storm is a golden sky and the sweet silver song of a lark. Walk on through the wind, walk on the the rain, though your dreams be tossed and blown. Walk on, walk on, with hope in your heart and you’ll never walk alone. You’ll never walk alone.

Sounds cliché but its most often the best of us that dont realise our true worth. I hope that you do.

"Just because you're not doing ""perfect"" doesn't mean you aren't doing great!

Four years free from your eating disorder is a damn fine accomplishment. If you relapse, I'm confident you can pull yourself out again and go for even longer next time.

Escaping an abusive relationship is incredibly hard for most people. And you did it. Three years is a long time but too many people let it go on even longer than that. You were able to see it for what it was and make a very hard decision. The right decision.

As so many people have said, you're also extraordinarily pretty. People ghost for many reasons, but your appearance certainly isn't one of them.  In particular, you have very expressive eyes. They look so sad here, but that's because they are the eyes of a genuine, empathetic person.

I'll also admit that I looked at some of your old posts, because I like to find things beyond ""you're pretty"" to compliment people on. Successful or not, running your own business is a brave thing to do - I'm a bit older than you and it's something I've always dreamed of but been too afraid to do. Another example of the bravery that's going to pull you out of some dark days.

PS: this isn’t an advice sub, but therapy has done wonders for me, and if you aren’t getting some I’d like to suggest it. You’ve been through a lot, and some help processing all of that is priceless.

"I've had friends and family members who have committed suicide or suffered accidental deaths at their own hands (overdose), and I've been unsuccessful in finding someone or having a relationship that wasn't strictly casual since my separation 4 years ago, and I've been clinically depressed since I was 15.

But we're still here, and there's still more to do and to see, to learn and to feel.

In hard times, our minds like to wallow in the misery and trick us into thinking that's all there will ever be.  Don't listen to it, our brains are jerks.

And not sure if this helps, or if you are suffering from depression or not, but depression isn't a mood or symptom, it's just a state your brain finds itself in.  That doesn't mean you can't be depressed and still feel good things or feel good about things.  Not trying to downplay depression, it's horrible, and for some people it's hard to see past.  Whatever you do, don't live for your depression, live for the things the depression tries its damnedest to keep you from seeing.",2,ToastMe

Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold

It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored

"It’s really important to know that you’re not alone. The holidays can make this situation a lot tougher, and it’s really easy to feel alone and depressed. Dating can be pretty shitty, since I [22M] got out of my last relationship I’ve been ghosted and cancelled on last minute a bunch. One of my closest friends  OD’d two years ago, and a little over a year ago I tried to take my own life after a long battle with depression and came very close to succeeding.

That was a few years ago and I have since moved into a beautiful place and my life has never been more stable, and my confidence and self worth have never been greater. You’ll get there girl, you just gotta keep on going.

As for how you’ve been feeling,  One thing that worked for me when I was depressed between bad relationships was fitness (and I appreciate that this is totally unsolicited advice so please ignore if that’s your preference). For me, having an hour a few days a week or so to focus on getting a little better at lifting weights, running or walking was cathartic, helped me manage my funk and helped me foster some self-satisfaction.  As you improve (always at your own pace, mind you) it gives you a sense of achievement and empowerment.

"Never forget the hard work and challenges you've had to over come in order to be where you are now. The hardest part of keeping your chin up is reminiscing in the past. The past is no longer a threat, the abuse is hurtful but you left meaning you wanted to heal and you're doing an amazing job. Never give up and never give in to the pain. You will beat the sadness and overcome the pain. You're a beautiful and powerful individual and I know you're stronger than this. Proof you say: you left an abusive relationship and if that's not a victory then I don't know what is. The Reddit community will always be here for you. I'm sorry it's hard but that's sadly how life is, it has its ups and downs and you are sadly at a low but now don't forget the highs are coming. You will never be in a abusive relationship again because now you know the signs. You're much smarter than before and you will find someone who will treat you like the queen you are. Getting ghosted sucks I know believe me but they couldn't handle you anyway so for now if it's possible smile and remember that there is a whole community that cares for you and wants you to be okay. 

The eating disorder is a big deal but you've beat it once and you can do it again. Talk to the community and ask for help, I'm sure someone on here can talk you through ways to stay on top of that and keep it in check. I hope you aren't to lonely and if you are well the least I can say is Happy Holidays and it was so nice to see someone get out of an abusive relationship you rock and have more potential than you know. Keep loving forward and don't let the past pain hurt you. 

Sending you lots of hugs and love, I had someone close to me do the same a few years back and it never gets easy.

I am sure lots of people have said great things. It’s hard to feel the good stuff when so much bad is going on. I cant imagine how you must feel. 

I lost a dear friend in my early twenties. The pain wracked me for years. I had to move. I couldnt stand seeing the places we used to spend so much time together. Even 10 years later I went to one of our spots and I started crying.

I can say things got better. New memories stacked on top of the old ones. Sure there are new pains too but the relationships I kept have grown stronger and sweeter with age. It was unexpected  the people who stayed in my life but I am so grateful for them.  I couldn’t have predicted who would truly matter.  If I’d give advice to my younger self it would be to be happy with the people you are with for that day and don’t have any expectations for tomorrow. 

You seem to be trying to do better and that’s half the battle. Don’t give up and it will get better.",2,ToastMe
"It's been 4 years since I left the abusive relationship I was in. I spiraled hard and I honestly think I went manic there for a while. I did crazy impulsive things and I drank to blackout virtually every night while somehow functioning. I also did the tinder thing with the bad hookups and drugs, it was so dark. This past year has kind of been the beginning of my recovery. Finally getting into regular therapy is whats helped me the most. It's still hard and I'm still lost and confused and way more fearful of things than I once was but I'm getting my courage back. I met an amazing partner who's exactly right for me and healthy!

I am very proud of you. I couldnt imagine having the strength to do that after experiencing something so impactful as losing a best friend, your (I imagine) one escape from your relationship. That's some tough, unfair shit. I believe in you and if you ever need someone who's been through a portion of what you're dealing with (I'm F22 as well!) my DMs are open. It's a fresh but raw start.

It's honestly so important to take that time for you and for healing. You deserve that time and you deserve healing. Often, eating disorders are a way to have control.

Hey if you need someone i can always lend an ear or shoulder. Getting out is hard and the first step. Being ghosted is sort of the natural process for the dating scene sadly it is absolutely nothing personal.

Eventually one day you will wake up and notice the weight has been lifted from your shoulders and you’ll feel like you’ve been reborn. When you get to that point, you probably won’t be bothered by being ghosted because you may ghost a few people yourself!

"I am so sorry to hear what you are going through. 20 years ago I was with someone abusive and it made me suicidal for a long time.  I kept going on dates with men who ghosted me and treated me like shit. Last guy blocked me everywhere after we dated a month and then had sex. It really broke me.

Few months later I met my now husband. 

In those years before I met him which was a looong time being alone I had the best time. (It’s great now too lol) I traveled the world, met new friends and became a lot more confident.

What I’m trying to say is that it will get better. Sure, you’ll have shit days and won’t always be happy. Because that’s life. You don’t always have to be happy that’s unrealistic and will just make you more miserable trying to achieve that.

You’re super cute and that short hair looks great on you! Not everyone can pull it off. 

Please hold on. You’re so young and there are so many more exciting things ahead of you I promise. You have a clean slate now and can be whoever and whatever you want to be. It’s easy for me to say but take it one day at a time. Be proud that you made it through today. ❤️",2,ToastMe

Take your time, be patient, and enjoy the quality time developing yourself while you search for that person who wants to develop by your side.

I’m so sorry about your friend. 

Things are sad and lonely now but the world and our lives rarely stay the same. It will get better. If you ever need to vent or just get your mind off things, feel free to dm me. I find ranting at strangers very therapeutic at times so I’m always willing to lend an ear.",2,ToastMe

If you’re ED is coming back, I’d say therapy if you can, writing can help with intrusive thoughts, writing them out can sometimes have the same emotional release as acting it out, at least that’s what my therapist said.

"May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you be at peace. I’m going to tell you what I needed someone else to tell me when I have a depressive episode: You are going to be ok. This pain is going to pass. I know it hurts,  but it will get better. You are not alone. There are many people who care about you. I don’t know how the mental health support situation is where you live, but I strongly recommend you find a therapist or a group wherever you are for what you’re dealing with.

Happy Holidays!",2,ToastMe
"For a lot of us, it’s difficult to put ourselves first.  Staying in an abusive relationship is a good example of this- we say and do things to please others because their happiness is what we think makes us happy.

I’m glad you got away.  Now it’s time to work on *you*.  There is nothing wrong with being single.  Find out who you are.

There is nothing quite like a bad relationship to let you know what you really need in a good one.

You’re very pretty, and someone is out there for you.  You’ll find that person when you find yourself.

I was in an abusive relationship for two years - mentally wrecked me.  I got out of that one and replaced my “addiction” to her with working out.  I put on a boatload of muscle and am happier now than I ever was with her.  I met a new gal online, and am now married with a daughter.

Life will find you, and love will be waiting.",2,ToastMe
Getting out of a abusive relationship is terrifyingly difficult it doesn't feel like there's a life outside of it until you finally see another way to go. Its fantastic your finding that way to go and I hope you find someone who treats you how you deserve to be treated,2,ToastMe
Seems like all of the people who you’ve gone on dates with are super forgetful.,2,ToastMe

"Damn, you're incredibly strong for breaking such a pattern. I know how freaking hard it is to leave a relationship like that. And you had a friend committing suicide happen as wel?! That must have felt so insanely painful and sad, I am so sorry. :(❤️

"Dudette, your timing is perfect.  1) you're stunning. 2) at 22, you've learnt from some mistakes, but have looooads of time to do amazing things.   

At 22, I dumped my controlling deadbeat ex of 4 years (and at that point only serious relationship) and went traveling. Did some crazy stuff, and learned a lot about myself.  

Not saying that's necessarily what you should do, but I wish now-36 year old me could speak to  then-22 year old me and tell them of all the great times ahead.

You'll come out of this, better than ever, I promise.

As an aside, I know being with someone helps, but maybe take some time to be selfish and focus just on you - forget relationships for a while, just  get back into being the best you can.  

Your current shitty situation re: 6 month lease has a fixed ticking clock - if you literally do nothing, it will mostly resolve itself, so leave it as much as poss, and focus on the bits you can improve.  

P.s. honestly, you're a knock-out.  You've got this.",2,ToastMe

it takes a lot of strength to leave in an abusive situation. you're stronger than you know.,2,ToastMe
"I have been going through a similar situation as well, as I just left a manipulative relationship, it is very hard getting out, although my situation is probably not as bad as yours.  You are pushing through strong.  To go through so much struggling especially after the loss of your best friend, is overwhelming and isolating.  Now while it may be hard to believe you will be able to build new strong bonds, it could be absolutely unexpected, it sometimes takes a bit to find those bonds you deserve and need; but they will come as you are a beautiful person, and you still kept trying even with all that weighing you down.  Someone will see the goodness in you.

If you ever need someone to talk to, you can message me, or try to reach out to someone who you know you can trust, you deserve it.",2,ToastMe
"Leaving an abusive relationship is Sooooo hard. You did it!! Be proud that you are one of the strongest people out there.

"You're a beautiful person and I'm glad that you left that relationship, I've been in the same situation with a girl but I left only after an year and a half I finally realized what I was into and got myself out even tho I'm incapable of loving someone for real after that experience.",2,ToastMe
"I am EXTREMELY proud of you for getting out the abusive relationship. It sucks that you two must remain roommates for another six months, but I hope that they will go by quickly. Honestly, dating is extremely hard. Ghosting happens all the time, no matter what you look like or how well the date is going. It’s very weird and it can take a toll of self-esteem (I’ve been ghosted quite a bit and it still makes me cry a lot). But you’re absolutely beautiful and you seem like a very big-hearted person and I have no doubt that someone is going to find you to be absolutely delightful and want to date you until the end of time. Have you spoken to anyone about your eating disorder coming back? I know that you’ve been in recovery for quite some time but because you can’t control other situations, it probably decided to flair up again. I’m also really sorry to hear about the loss of your friend. Maybe a good and nice thing that could help you would be planning something to honor them? It doesn’t have to be big but it could give you a sense of closure and allow you to heal in more ways than one. I hope that 2020 treats you with love and respect.",2,ToastMe
"You’re brave.

You’re special.

You’re worth. 

Abusers, mentally or physically, are scum. Slime underneath a boot no one wants to wear. Thank you for knowing yourself enough to leave.

We miss your friend as much as you do. It may not seem like it, but any kind soul lost is one that we all feel. 

You’re never lonely. Even if all the people were gone, you still have a good book, you still have a sunflower in June, and you still have the sun. Knowledge, beauty, and life. Three good friends if you stop to talk to them every now and again. 

Much love.",2,ToastMe
"Dude!!!! That's amazing, that you broke free.  You're stronger for that alone than I could ever be
  I'm trying to leave one now, and I can't muster up the courage to do it.  Worried about dying alone, you know? 

Anyway, when I feel lonely, I try to remind myself that I am not the only lonely one on the planet, contrary to what why chemical imbalance causes me to believe. 

Like, fuck!!!! We are all isolated here on this planet at the same time; on a mote of dust screaming thru near infinite space.  Yea we are all alone. But we are all here together.  We are all alone, together. 

Together. 

Now I'm crying.  

I don't know you. I don't know anyone here.  But I love you, if only because you are a human and I am a human and that shit is fucking crazy.  We owe it to one another-and to ourselves-to be excellent to each other.

"That's awful, I'm sorry you're going through this, if it's any comfort the dating setbacks are temporary,  you're gorgeous so lots of men will be interested, and while a lot of us suck some men are good people and they'll be as interested as the creeps.",2,ToastMe
"OMG, you’re so adorable! Good for you for summoning the courage to leave! Don’t break your lease but find some other place to stay, even if you have to couch surf for a while. Lean on your support system — friends, family, coworkers, whoever. Contact a domestic violence shelter. They may at least be able to point you toward some resources. Don’t try to date yet, but work in your healing and your mental health. This is not the end for you, it’s only the beginning!",2,ToastMe

"As someone who’s been similarly ghosted in pretty much every scenario, or let down in other way all I can say I’m proud of you for being so strong. It’s an incredibly tough feeling putting your heart out to people and being kicked down because of it. I also similarly lost my best Friend about a year ago, which has been an incredibly painful experience to deal with. I just want to say that you’re strong. You’ve made it this far through all the lonely nights and tear-jerking moments. You are bound to your future, which from the looks of it is incredibly bright. I wish you the best in your endeavors, and never stop smiling and never quit on yourself. You’re too amazing for that <3",2,ToastMe

"You’ve come so far! I am proud of you internet stranger. I also had an abusive relationship around your age, I also remember how free I felt after I left him. Take your time healing and learning to love yourself, I know that person could have done some damage to your self perception. You are enough, you can be happy by yourself and you don’t have to prove your worth to anyone. Just don’t give up hope with people, you will find your tribe/s.o someday. 

Also, you are incredibly pretty, love the haircut. It frames your face so beautifully but to be honest, I think you can pull of any style if you want to. Best of luck and lots of love!",2,ToastMe
Someday you will look back at this time as the start of a new statisfying and happy live!,2,ToastMe
"You are stunning! I am so sorry for everything you have gone through, but you are incredibly strong for getting yourself out of a bad situation. Anyone who ghosted you is clearly unworthy and just saved you time, you are an absolute queen and I would be thrilled to know you and be considered a friend to you. I am so sorry for the pain of losing your best friend, my heart aches for the suffering they felt and the loneliness you now have to endure. I am sure they would be so proud of you.

Don't be hard on yourself for what you are going through now, if you are going through 100 challenges it is impossible to be perfect through all of them and you are doing such a fantastic job in spite of it all. I can see there is pain in your eyes, but also incredible vibrancy. You are strong and you are going to be ok, and I will be thinking about you through the holidays into the next year. You've got this ❤️",2,ToastMe
"First of all, I’m so sorry all of this has been happening to you. I admire you for being strong enough to leave that relationship. Please know that relationship is not a reflection of who you are but of who they are, you deserve happiness and love. I hope you find a way to break your lease somehow, I was in a similar situation living with an ex and it wasn’t fun. 

I believe you’ll be strong enough to defeat your eating disorder, you’ve beat it back before you can do it again, just hang in there.

As for the ghosted dates, try to see it as the universe telling you these people aren’t worthy of you and it’s setting you up for someone better and worthwhile. 
You’re incredibly pretty and I hope you find the happiness you deserve soon! 

Stay strong",2,ToastMe
"Hey there, I'm proud of you for getting out of an abusive relationship because it takes courage. You're such a strong person and I want you to know that the negative things your ex said about you are NOT TRUE! As far as dating goes, some people just aren't right for us or are too immature to reject someone they're not interested in. Despite that, you are worthy, loved, important, and beautiful. Being in a relationship is great, but it isn't everything. Someone amazing will come along when the time is right. For right now, I recommend working on yourself and trying out things you couldn't do either because of your ex or because you hadn't tried them before! Idk if you can afford treatment, but that may be a good option. If not, I recommend being honest and vulnerable with a close friend about the eating disorder. The right, supportive friend will want what's best for you and won't be upset. Sorry to hear that you're sad and lonely, but Reddit is a great place to make friends!

I hope you find a solution for it. But quiet honestly you're beautiful! You have the cutest little smile and button nose! This is a hard time in life for everyone, you've got a bigger issue than most but I'd say the person who felt the need to say hurtful stuff to you have bigger problems with their self esteem. 

You can wear a hat, look beautiful without hair, or wear a wig but that person will have to work hard for years to fix her ugly personality.",2,ToastMe

"One of my sister’s friends growing up has the same issue. There thing is that you have to be extremely shallow to judge someone on something as hair. You have a beautiful face and amazing eyes on top of your obvious deeply caring personality and heart of gold. WHO you are is so much more than what your hair is doing. Even if you were to go bald you’d still have a beautiful face, amazing eyes, a heart of gold and a soul of sunshine.

"Hair does not make the person. I personally shave my head, yes, I am a guy, but my wife also has thinning hair. It bothers her that she is losing her hair but not me. 

I know it is hard but there are several options available. The cheapest, best, most honest, but hardest is just accept it. Shave it, you will love it.

Hair plugs, transplants, and the prescription options are way more scary and expensive.  But, these past couple of months I've been using Toppik hair fibers and its been really helpful. I definitely recommend it because it's inexpensive, safe, and easy, but still do your research. I hope this helps someone out there!",2,ToastMe

you’re so cute🥺,2,ToastMe
"First off- great username! Secondly, you’re quite attractive, so that cancels out the hair loss, lol. And third, you can shave your head and be a prime candidate for wigs!! I have always thought that wigs are cool as shit. With them, you can change up your hair whenever you please! Plus you can rock all sorts of fun hats!

"You can tell by your face you are a sweet person. The mean individual who made a comment isn't a kind or sweet person. Being kind is how we show others that we love ourselves. The fact that you would not do that to someone else means you are kind. Know that person doesn't have self love and how sad that is truly. You deserve more kindness, from others especially.

<3 Great job trying to keep your head up. People can be so cruel. I love your shirt and your face and your curls are perfect! <3,2,ToastMe
"You have a ton of comments but I wanted to still put my two cents in.

I use to work with a wonderful lady who had a condition that never let her hair on her head grow minus a few strands. When she was a kid she went through hell about it. But when I met her she seemed confident. The best thing I ever heard her say was when a coworker asked her why she didn’t wear a wig, she simply stated that why would she cover up when she was that beautiful. 

She and I would rub our bald heads together in unity. We both rocked that bald is beautiful. 

Allow me to note something very obvious about you. You are stunning. You have a bone structure that is worthy of envy and your cheeks are the type that other people get injections to try and emulate.

Take it from a bald stranger, not everyone can rock this look and you are gorgeous now and forever.

I also love how already you’re working on building confidence in others that might be going through the same changes. That’s leadership and so glamorous. I’m very impressed with you. You deserve another award.",2,ToastMe
"I approve YOU, you have a very pretty and friendly face <3",2,ToastMe
That t shirt is so cute and you have the prettiest face 😭,2,ToastMe
"Your smile is infectious, don't take the idiots to heart. I'm sending a virtual toast. Keep strong.",2,ToastMe
I approve,2,ToastMe
You’re beautiful!  I hope you believe that in your heart and remember that someone being mean says everything about them and nothing about you.,2,ToastMe
"Imagine being so beautiful that someone tried to insult the amount of keratin that grows out of your scalp because everything else about you is so perfect. You can rock any look, unfortunately they can’t even rock their shitty personality.",2,ToastMe
I’m struggling with this as well. You’re not alone and I’m a young girl.,2,ToastMe
"You just have the prettiest face in the world and look like a truly wonderful person! I know, if it gets to that stage, you'll fully rock the bald look :)",2,ToastMe
"I had alopecia when I was 12, turning 13. I got bullied so so bad for it and I was so ashamed I have literally 0 photos of when I was a teen. I wish now I could have seen it as I do now - it’s just hair, it can grow back and a bald head is actually a super cute look. And wigs are fun too!

I think it’s something that needs more awareness so it can teach young people that actually, everything is okay.",2,ToastMe
As a guy with quite hairy chest and legs and with alopecia areata on his arms I can relate to the mean comments. People can be dicks sometimes.,2,ToastMe
Honestly I’m 19 and am balding like crazy. The top of my head looks almost exactly like yours. It’s so fucking frustrating as a female to deal with this and I really appreciate you posting this to bring more awareness to it. Hit me up whenever if you wanna talk miracle cures that probably won’t work. Or shit on family meme gets that don’t understand,2,ToastMe
"I am a 31 year old woman struggling with hair loss. It started when I was about 24 but I aaaaalways have had super fine, thin hair. My mom has the same hair type and has almost no hair left at 65. So I know it's in my Gene's! Plus it got way worse after I had my first kid - he's 21 months old and it's still very sparse.

All this to say, you are NOT alone! I know how tough it is because everywhere you look, you see women (and men!) with thick, beautiful manes. When people with 'normal' hair complain about their tresses, you just want to point at your head and say 'at least you HAVE hair!'

But take comfort, because you're not the only one ❤",2,ToastMe
"Now that's a Seal of approval!! 

You're smile is so warming and joyous you gave me a big smile too. :) 

Its great to see a beautiful person smile, so don't stop!",2,ToastMe
My hair loss has gotten a little better since I switched some meds but I will probably always have very thin hair in the front. It's embarrassing but I'm still cute and so are you!,2,ToastMe
"You can definitely get away with a shaved head (something i wish I had! I’m a male and don’t have the face for it).

I think you’d look good, and perhaps that would make you feel more comfortable, especially once you “own” it. Just my two cents. But I think you look great either way :)",2,ToastMe

Anyways, her elementary days were pretty difficult but she blossomed in her teens (jrhigh/highschool)  Became one of the most stoic mo fuggas I know and she's a great person.  I don't see how you wouldn't be also.  People who are insecure insult people for the stupidest reasons.

"You’re so cute!! Like, really cute. I know it’s a simple compliment but that was the first thing I thought when I saw your picture so I thought it’d be good to tell you. :)",2,ToastMe
"What I took from these photos immediately is that by putting on that hair accessory, ( sorry I am a guy, don't know specific terms) is that you are still comfortable drawing attention to it. That's a good thing because you look like a beautiful and confident young woman. In my opinion you would look good with very short hair as well, and I mean it when I say not everyone can pull that look off. 

Oh, and awesome tshirt!",2,ToastMe
"You’re beautiful, love! And not in a patronizing way. You’re honestly easy on the eyes and seem to have the heart to match.

"Obviously you have a very pretty face, and whoever said shit about your hair is jealous. You are beautiful, and remember you can always change hair (extensions, wig, shave it and be a badass)... but that person can never change how ugly and rotten they are in their core!

"For starters- you’re so pretty and have a great smile... and I live your T.  With that said, have you had your thyroid levels checked? I had a friend who had the same problem and I suggested she go to her doctor bc thinning hair can be caused by your thyroid levels being off. Sure enough I was right.  If your dr. Has t already, ask them to check for you.  

In the meantime, stay the beautiful girl you are!!

"You put the hair loss pic in the center and somehow I still saw your sweet smile first :) you’re gorgeous, girl! And on a functional level it’s hidden really well!",2,ToastMe
To be honest you are blessed with a very pretty face. This also means you can rock short hairstyles (and probably rock a buzz cut if you wanted to try one).,2,ToastMe
"So you so damn adorable!! Listen, you are not alone in this, find people who are experiencing the same condition and talk to them.  I would say get their support but I get the feeling they will get a lot of your support too.  And whoever this person is, they have a rotten core. Most likely because they get hate so I would say fuck’em.  But let’s assume they have bigger problems so wish them well and send them on their way.",2,ToastMe

"Seriously, if you haven't already try shaved. I'm a guy so take with a grain of salt but when I started balding in my early 20s I decided to go for it and it looks better than any ""hide it"" strategy. Plus from the leftmost pic, it looks like you have a good head shape for it!",2,ToastMe
Your face is absolutely like a beautiful doll face,2,ToastMe

"Honestly I didn't notice the hair loss until I read what you posted. 1st thing I believe most people noticed was your smile. Keep that, that's something nothing that can go away!",2,ToastMe
"Your makeup looks really pretty and your smile is so nice too! 

I'm also a female who has struggled with hair loss since puberty, so I know how it feels to have bald spots and/or thinning patches of hair when you're in your teens. I've had to deal with so many people rudely pointing out that I'm ""bald"" or that ""stress must be making your hair fall out"". You're definitely not alone in this struggle.

Don't let those people who are mean get to you. What's important is that you love yourself as you are. I used to get really down about it, but I've really done my best to love myself despite my thin hair that falls out in clumps. Honestly, that change in attitude has helped so much, and I'm glad that you're working on self love; it's so important for everyone to love themselves.",2,ToastMe

"One of the women I looked up to most in my life had alopecia. I met her when she was around 19 and had just decided to shave her head. She was so adamant about not letting her hair hold her back, she took all her insecurity and turned it into motivation. I saw her get promoted twice, take on more responsibilities than I could imagine. Shes motivated me to do so much and be so much, more thzn I was. I was 5 years older than her. We're both out the military now and have done our separate ways but I always think of her when my physical insecurities get me down. 

Your insecurities are only there if you allow them to be. Keep your head up and shine on young star!",2,ToastMe

"The sweetest woman I ever met was my aunt Florence.  I can’t begin to tell you what a beautiful person she was. She had a wig for special occasions but most of the time she just went natural. Her hair was about like an older mans combover but all over her head.  You could easily see her scalp. I miss her. Be yourself. Do what makes you comfortable.  Learn the good in yourself and try to change the bad. Don’t let the bad get you down, dealing with it brings true maturity.  Be ever so blessed! Thanks for reminding me of her!",2,ToastMe
"Gorgeous face! And hair can be faked until restored (if that’s how you want to handle it). 
People are assholes. If you learn how to dismiss them now, it will make the late teens/20’s SO much easier when it comes to handling mean girls!",2,ToastMe
I completely focused on your perfect skin and never even noticed your hair. I have a friend who had alopecia and one day she shaved it all off bc she wasn’t going to let it get the best of her. She was never more beautiful than the day she showed her head who was boss.,2,ToastMe
"You are a beautiful young lady, and that beauty comes from within. Focus on feeding your self confidence, cause you 100% deserve to be loved by yourself.

If people are rude, just remind yourself that's their way of them projecting their own insecurities on you. They couldn't fathom the strength you have from the pain you've encountered. On the flip side, you probably have stronger empathy and social skills. Also, most people are awkward af. Me included.

I shaved my head twice (fundraising/support) and had some pretty interesting conversations with folks. I noticed people tended to be pretty cool about it once they realized how confident I was. I also met a significant other that I dated for a couple years well bald. 

Hair isn't everything. I'd rather have heart than hair again anyday.",2,ToastMe

That's too bad if people choose to be mean to you because it looks like they'd be missing out on an opportunity to meet a genuinely good person ;)",2,ToastMe
You have a great head. I would just shave. You are beautiful either way but it's something to think about!,2,ToastMe
"You and your hair look beautiful no matter what you do with it but thought I might offer a hair style suggestions just in case you're interested. My SIL and niece's hair look almost exactly like yours and this past summer my niece decided to get a pixie cut, she styles it up kinda like [this](https://images.app.goo.gl/dzxuTRSGZq2GU6Yu6) and that style makes the thin parts virtually invisible. 

I don't struggle with thin hair but I've been rockin a 1/8inch buzz cut for the past three years and have never gotten so many compliments in my life. People don't need hair to be beautiful and the hair that you have it gorgeous just the way it is.",2,ToastMe

"21m dealing with my own hair problems. something i’ve noticed is that when a person makes any kind of comment calling attention to an insecurity of yours, it’s usually coming from a place of immaturity or lack of social awareness. little kids will say unfiltered things like “oh wow what’s wrong with your hair”, whereas adults and good people will look past whatever your insecurity might be. those are the real ones.",2,ToastMe
"I've been struggling with hair loss myself and it really sucks. I lost over 65kg and went from being ""the fat guy"" to ""the bald guy"", specially because the testosterone levels spike with the weight loss, and high testosterone aggravates hair loss even further.

A wonderful community that is mainly male dominated, but also has some kickass and beautiful women who did the big shave for one reason or another and look just as beautiful if not more than they did before.

"You have a great smile and your eyebrow game is completely on point! People who get so caught up in some missing follicles are just telling you they're not worth your time.

As an aside, there was a young woman who I often saw in the city who was completely bald (she had no eyebrows either, but looked very well and I saw her for several years here and there, so I'm guessing alopecia rather than medical treatment). But she just always looked so amazing, rocking big dangly earrings, always looking happy and surrounded by people, and had such a... I don't know how to say it, a shapely scalp? I always felt like going up and saying how great she looked but even though I'm also female and not interested in that way I didn't want to sound like a creeper. But yeah, she definitely made it a feature, and it made me wish there were more bald women in the world and we weren't all so caught up with being measured to the same boring standard.",2,ToastMe

You're your own harshest critic. Even without your hair, you're still so pretty. Your eyes are sparkling, your skin looks *so* clear and nice, and you look like a genuinely sweet person. Forget what above says to you. If someone looks at you and decides to make you feel bad when you're already down, they're a pathetic pos who doesn't deserve your time or emotional energy.

In this world it is so hard to be different, so so incredibly hard that sometimes it is easier to be extraordinary. And you my dear have just that in you. Just as we are here for you in this time, you will be there for others. You are special, you have meaning, and we are all cheering for you.",2,ToastMe

"Uh... hello, living abortion.

I guess I’m also a living abortion? If my parents hadn’t gone to America to give birth to me, I would’ve been aborted because of China’s one birth policy. My sisters are twins, so neither of them were aborted. 

Being a living abortion is great! This is the mindset to adopt:

People on the internet are a bunch of ducking pieces of shit. Don’t mind them. They can say hurtful things, but you don’t have to internalize it. Everyone has things they’re self conscious about. 
If you really care about your hair so much, just wear a hate or something. It really isn’t that bad.",2,ToastMe
"I can't fully relate, but I struggled with some stress related hair loss during my studies and it really upset me, because I was always complimented for it.. In any case, 1.5 years ago, I decided to chop it short for this exact reason. I didn't want to feel like I'm no longer pretty, just because I didn't have long hair or full hair in general. Even though it's back to normal now, I just wanted to say this: I've never felt more empowered and beautiful than when I cut it off. You don't need thick hair to be beautiful. You don't need long hair to be beautiful.

You already are beautiful!",2,ToastMe
You look like someone who would brighten even my worst day with a smile and a hello  : ),2,ToastMe
"You are gorgeous- you’ve got a beautiful face and you’re eyebrows are so good. I love how you style your hair. You’ve got one of those faces that if you had no hair, people would still notice your beauty. Hair does not make the woman. Xo",2,ToastMe

You have a great face for it😍",2,ToastMe

"So the other day I was at a show. The violin player had THE most badass hair or really lack there of. It was kinda frowed around her head but transparent. It was very thin all around. The lights reflected off of it in a really cool way. Kinda had a glow to it or halo. Very modern/forward  looking but totally unexpected. She was way older, extremely talented and swooned the entire room with her music. But her very thin hair stood out to me in a really cool way.",2,ToastMe
Dunno how you feel bout needles but honestly you’d make a killer Viking women with a proper tated head,2,ToastMe

I will say this (and I really hope that you take this as a compliment) but I have super short hair and I think that you would look excellent with super short hair. Like, you have the face structure for it and not many women do. I love the clip in your hair as well. Basically no matter what you do, you’re going to look fly as fuck.",2,ToastMe
You have amazing dimples! It makes your smile that much better!,2,ToastMe

I’m 40 years old and my eyebrow game isn’t that strong.,2,ToastMe
If there is one girl I have ever seen that does not need hair it is you.  Your face is so stunning that hair only takes away from your beauty.,2,ToastMe
You are absolutely stunning. Anyone who makes time to comment rudely on any part of your appearance really has some deeper issue with themselves. Your hair is nothing to be ashamed of and your smile radiates confidence. I’m sorry I can’t form anything better than this but—you are just BEAUTIFUL!! Never let anyone tell you otherwise because it simply is not true.,2,ToastMe
Keep on going you are cool!,2,ToastMe
You make me more happy  than a smiling dog in Nintendogs,2,ToastMe
"You are stunning. Who cares what other people say. My husband is losing hair and he was feeling really self conscious about it. I told him to embrace it!!!! He did, and he looks amazing! He looked amazing before anyway  but he felt good about it and it made him much more attractive. 

I think you could DEF rock a shaved head like a bad ass!!!",2,ToastMe
You are beautiful! Your fashion choices are your own and I’m sure you know what all you can do if you want to change things up. But you are perfect in your own skin and anyone that can’t see it reflected in them is a dirty ass mf you can kindly pay no mind to.,2,ToastMe

"Take it from an old lady, dear:
Miserable people say miserable things. So you can rest assured that what that person said really wasn’t about you, but that person had stinking waves of nastiness emanating from them and he or she hates himself/herself.
You have both an absolutely LOVELY face AND a sense of humor. I think things are going to go very well for you once you get past this bumpy time.
Plus I would kill for your brows.",2,ToastMe
"You could totally rock a buzz cut, wear a wig, or continue to just have the hair you have.  Those are superficial external attributes.  The person who was hurtful to you has ugliness inside and that can’t be changed so easily.  You have an aesthetic thing, but they have something that is at their core.  I feel sorry for them.",2,ToastMe
"As a person who's attracted to women, nothing is as attractive as a girl with short or no hair. It shows confidence and that's hot af. Just own it girl. You've got a beautiful face to focus on. No need to hide behind hair.",2,ToastMe

"Oh you are a beauty! I have struggled with pulling my own hair out since puberty (trichotillomania) and contended with larger or smaller bald patches over the years and people who feel they have a right to comment. But look at your shining eyes and gorgeous smile! Those commenters of yours were jealous, insecure and small minded. You've got it all going on, plus a fantastic t shirt! You rock ❤️",2,ToastMe
Your curls are so beautiful! You are very lucky,2,ToastMe

She wears it proudly and everyone loves her for her BEAUTIFUL BALD head.  She literally just walks in and owns a room due to her love of people and honestly YOU CAN DO THE SAME.  Wear the love of self.  I think you're beautiful!",2,ToastMe
"I've never understood people who tease other people for how they look. It's not as if you made your hair thin on purpose. Although even if you did, that doesn't give someone the right to make nasty comments. You're lovely.",2,ToastMe
Brows on point! You’re so pretty and that shirt is a must have 💕,2,ToastMe

"A good friend of mine (who always had amazing curly hair) took the plunge a year or two ago and BUZZED it. And you know what? She looks absolutely incredible! Completely gorgeous. Not a lot of people look just as beautiful without hair as with it, but you definitely do! You could shave it all off and wouldn't be any less beautiful! (And the seal shirt is darling! 😊)",2,ToastMe
You’re beautiful ❤️I have trichotillomania and my hair is one of my biggest insecurities. Thanks for being yourself.,2,ToastMe

You have flawless looking skin and your eyeliner is perfect :),2,ToastMe
"For what it's worth, you look lovely (wish my eyebrows looked even half as good!) and seem like a sweet, smart person. I swear there's nothing uglier than meanness and cruelty and some people just don't have the awareness to keep their mean words to themselves - I know mean comments hurt, but remember that they say more about the person saying them than they do about you! You are braver and stronger than someone who makes themselves feel 'better' by making hurtful comments. And I mean, I have no idea why they were even commenting on your hair when the first thing I noticed skin is amazing! So clear and radiant. If you have a skincare routine, you need to start sharing it with the world because damn.

&#x200B;

Also I very much do love the seal of approval shirt :)",2,ToastMe
"You have such a great sense of humor, would love to have that shirt 👍",2,ToastMe
"Look, the fact is, you still look pretty despite your struggle with hair loss. I can imagine it sucks to have people comment on it. The person who said this is a sad pos to begin with, as that’s not cool in any decent person book. Everyone has a something they’re not happy with about themselves including the jerks that say hurtful things to you. The difference is, you don’t stoop to their level. This is key, as the stuff they say will come back. I’ve lived long enough to know this. Moreover, you will definitely find the right person, and it will take the sting out of every bad comment people have made in the past. This person will not see you for your insecurities, but for the beautiful person you really are. So things like your hair loss will not even be noticeable to them. You prob will think they’re just being nice, but the fact is, they’re not. They really won’t see it, because they’re looking at you for you, not at you for what you don’t like about yourself. So it really won’t be noticeable to them. You will see what I mean when it happens. In the interim, keep being a good person, and try to ignore douchebags. They’ll get theirs and you may even be around to see it. But remember keep being the good person you are, and you will find that joy without the restraints of your perceived flaws.",2,ToastMe
"You look like the young ladies from the 40's whose makeup, poise, and dress I always looked up to! Your makeup is perfect, but that's not the reason. You have the eyes, smile, and energy of a good, warm, welcoming heart and you're beautiful. I've had periods of alopecia, nothing like what you're going through, but enough to have bald patches and I was so upset. I can only imagine how you must feel, but I hope you can take solace in an internet stranger saying that you are beautiful, and that you are more than your hair!

Side note, when my hair got really bad for a period, I tried some wigs and it was sooo much easier for me to make cool hairstyles. You can make it fun, and change your look entirely with different wigs. OR, you can rock it and just be proud of who you are, your spirit and the memories you leave other people with!",2,ToastMe
"Who cares about hair ? Fuq em. 
Just look at your skin I would shave my eyebrows for a whole year just to have a smooth and beautiful skin like yours.",2,ToastMe

I’m sorry people have been cruel. You are very beautiful. I would recommend shaving your head. You’d look like a prettier version of Natalie Portman in V for Vendetta. :),2,ToastMe
You've got such a lovely bone structure that you'd look gorgeous with or without hair :),2,ToastMe
"You seem to be beautiful inside and out! And you can always use a weave or a wig if that is something that bothers you, although you could go as is too. You are very pretty!",2,ToastMe

"Having recently lived through a BMT for my brother, I am very aware of what you are all about.  Your outer beauty is only surpassed by your inner courage, your positive attitude, and the strength of your donor’s immune system!!
I hope you really understand ALL of the support you have out there as you continue this difficult process.  There are millions of us out there who are pulling for you because of what you represent to US.

Ultimately, my brother lost his battle last month, but he did many clinical trials with hopes that someone like you (and YOUR loved ones) would benefit someday ... by winning your battle.

Today, I will be (trying to) celebrating Christmas with my family...and it will be SO difficult, but I will share your story with them....during this season of “HOPE”.

It’s part of you ,  your confidence, and expression of your own style. But you’re absolutely rocking it. Your glasses fit your face shape so well and you’ve got the definition of a contagious smile. 
I’ve just been in a car accident and shouldn’t be using screens because of my concussion but I had to leave a comment on this one. Going through this has clearly made you gain so much perspective, and empathy that most people will never reach!

"Honestly dude, you look like the biggest Cinnamon Roll! I know things are tough right now, but you can do it, just focus on one step at a time! Message me if you need someone to talk to! :)",2,ToastMe
"Now I don't know why they hate you.
Now I don't know why these horrible circumstances happened to you.
But you know what? You should'nt hate yourself. There is still someone who loves you. There is still someone who needs you. You know what? Screw those hating you. I don't know your past, but what I do know? This life has more to offer. Trust me. If you are thinking of death, get some help. Call a suicide landline. Do anything that can help. We're here for you. Just don't end it all.",2,ToastMe
"though it may seem as though there is only negativity in your life, there is so much positivity and joy out there- people, hobbies.. that you are yet to uncover. Make it your mission to find these. I honestly can't wait for you to uncover the greatness this world can offer.",2,ToastMe
"Reminds me of Tyrian Lannister from Game of Thrones. All the same stuff happened to him. 

He kicked ass. Be like Tyrion. Ignore that you're way taller than him though.",2,ToastMe
"Even though death has been a factor that defined your life, it is only normal to feel like you deserve it, or that it might be the only answer. 

Let me tell you something, i have tried to kill myself 4 times now, every time failed, and every occurrence left me with scars(stomach and kidney issues from overdosing with painkillers, scars from cuts, cracked teeth from hanging). 

Never been to a mental facility, only one person IRL knows about this ( now y'all know, but anonymity helps) and somehow i ended up slightly better than what it was. So my brother, whatever it is, keep fighting cause you're worth it! Find your potential, isolate yourself into something creative and let your madness become material. Create, find people, love, laugh and eventually it will go away. And yes, i still have suicidal thoughts, but i don't care anymore, life is meant to be lived. 

Keep this in mind, be curious about what's next. This is what keeps me afloat, it might work on you.",2,ToastMe
You're surrounded by negativity! Keep reaching out for positive interactions like this! You're handsome and respectable and young- you've got everythingnto look forward to! This too shall pass!,2,ToastMe
"Everyone’s comments on here are wonderful, so there isn’t a whole lot for me to add, but I’ll try!

The one thing that has kept me going during the darkest, most horrible times is this: picture yourself in the future. Really picture it, say, five years from now. Where are you? What is your home like? Is it full of sunlight? Plants? Are you waking up with a warm cup of coffee or tea, sharing it with someone? Maybe it’s the weekend and you are excited for a bike ride you have planned, or maybe a trip to a flea market or a hike? Maybe you’re staying in, playing music or writing, making something with your hands? 

Picture it. Picture what you want. Project the future, and take a step towards it every day. This perfect morning is worth it, your happiness is worth it. You can use these hardships to strengthen you for future storms, use them to help others. You are special, loved, important, and you can make your life exactly the way you want it to be. 

I’m going to be 28 this month, and I’ve had to use this strategy a lot in my life. I thought I’d be dead, a drug addict, or selling my body by this point- but I’ve never done any of those things. I’m actually happy, despite horrible things still happening. You can do it too, my friend. I believe in you, truly. 

Also- if it interests you, Teal Swan is a wonderful self help YouTube lady. Her videos helped me rebuild my attitude towards myself and others, life in general really. Give it a go if you’re ever bored. 

You’ve got this!!",2,ToastMe
The fact that you're still here after all this means ya got an iron will and serious inner strength. You're like Aquaman!,2,ToastMe
"Your past is not who you are today. You are a tough person because you had to deal with all these things. Its also ok if you need help. You have a future and dont blame yourself for the things other people did. You are also pretty af. You can be hit. But you can always get up because the sun always raises again. Surrender is not an option. Because if you do, all effort will be in vain",2,ToastMe
"I don't know who you are but your story is very touching. You have been through a lot that many of us cannot relate to. But all I have to say is don't lose hope. You will always bounce back from any setbacks. That is what man has been doing for years and will continue doing. And when you bounce back, I guarantee you that you will. You have the guts to talk to random people on the internet about it speaks volumes of what you can do. You have so much potential to become a better person!",2,ToastMe
"If you’ve been through all this and are still here, doing everything that you do as your amazing self, you’re a tough one. I’m really sorry all this happened to you - you don’t deserve it :( 

You look like a wonderful guy. Hope things turn a bit sunnier for you!",2,ToastMe
Man that really fucking sucks it's okay to feel hurt it's normal but you're also strong enough to carry on I believe in you okay brother?,2,ToastMe
"Working on yourself is hard work and work that lots of people don’t do, and won’t understand. Learning to value yourself is hard, but you are amazing and resilient and working towards a better you. Shedding emotional baggage will open you up for a brighter/lighter future. You’ve got this! Good job reaching out when you need a lift :)",2,ToastMe
U cute af,2,ToastMe
"The simple fact that you're seeking help both professionally and putting yourself out here for us is proof that you want to stick around. Yeah, death looks like an attractive and easy way out, but you leave even the parts of your life you didn't realise were happy and reasons that you continue to withstand this pressure. There were moments that existed just between you and your girlfriend that only the two of you knew about. Those moments are what you hold on to, moments of time that were purely for the two of you, that nobody except you can take away. Be the person you wanted to become with her, for her. Do any and all of it for yourself, because you deserve it.",2,ToastMe
"Hi, you deserve to be here. You have a purpose, and you can move this mountain. Things will get better.",2,ToastMe
"I am really sorry for your loss and even though I don't know what it's like to go through all of that, I hope you remember that you won't always feel like this and that you are very strong for going on. I hope things will get better for you soon. I believe in your ability to turn this around, you got this!",2,ToastMe
"I hope you get out of there. Once you get rid of the toxic people dragging you down, the world will seem like a much bigger place",2,ToastMe
You are loved ❤️,2,ToastMe
"When I was 18 the only solution for me was death as well -- I'm 33 now, because ""I"" did ""die"".

I killed everything about my ""self"" that I hated, and concurrently created someone I could ""live with"" to take that place as my self. If you want more info I can give it, but the bottom line is you aren't who you were 5 years ago, you aren't who you were 10 years ago, and you aren't who you were when you were born -- so why can't you be someone different in 5 years from now?",2,ToastMe
"You will be fine, trust me. Your life story is not a happy one right now, but you can make a story with a happy end out of it! I'm sure you can do it, you have a really friendly face, I'm sure you will meet the right people in your life to help you to make your life a happy story. Everything will be okay!",2,ToastMe

"I'm right there with you. I grew up in an abusive home and bullied at school, my brother was the abuser and parents let him get away with it then they started to abuse and allowed their religion to become more important then their own children. 

I constantly was in a sea of depression because of that and almost killed myself when I was 17 after my parents threatened to kick me out because I didn't want to practice their faith. I was able to clear my head of all the negativity by connecting with nature, as weird as it sounds. Sat outside after hiking and just closed my eyes and listened to the sounds of the wind in the trees and the birds.

Recently I've my postpartum depression has gotten the better of me recently and had a really bad episode on Saturday and almost took myself out. I'm glad I didn't and had someone I could talk to about it. I have to keep pushing onwards for my daughter and the people around me who love me. 

I don't know what it's like to lose the person you love the most in the world but I do know what it's like to lose a family member and friends to suicide. You have my condolences for the loss of your loved one.

If you ever need someone who's fought through this before and just need someone to vent to or a friend, I'm right here. I'm great at listening. My theoretical door is always open.

As for an ego boost, because I like to hand them out like candy, that smile could melt the heart of even the coldest of people. Also I'm digging your beard. You look like a dapper gentleman! Also for whatever reason you look like you give fantastic hugs. :)

Remember you are loved, wanted, cherished, you do matter, you do belong, your feelings are valid. Don't believe the lies that the depression and the anxiety throws at you. <333333",2,ToastMe

"1.) Dope sweater, most of the men I know are horrible at putting a casual outfit together. That's a large positive in your direction, good husband material.

2.) Even with your insane depression, good on you for still getting out of bed, getting dressed, and grooming yourself. A lot of people can't keep that up with severe mental health issues, even the ones trying their hardest.

3.) Good handwriting! Honestly I wish the way I wrote wasn't doctor scribble, teach me.

4.) Family doesn't have to mean they are of blood relation to you, so if your current family is blaming you for your mother's passing... It wasn't your fault, you were a newborn baby, all you knew was a giant sack of water was your home for 9 months and now you're in a new world that's loud and bright. Obviously I did not know your mother but I know several mothers, and not a single one of them would blame ANY of their children if they died in childbirth. They love their kids and their first priority is always them first and foremost, often at the mother's expense (my niece sometimes went without eating to feed her son when money was tight).

I can tell you from experience with my own major depressive disorder, complex PTSD from an abusive breakup, and anxiety - death is a cop-out. I find I had the most intrusive thoughts when I won't face ny specific issue head on and address it immediately, and there were times my brain refused to see the light at the end of the tunnel. There is light, I found my hope again recently when my psychiatrist listened to me and sent me for a therapy I requested. Silly thing to gain so much hope from, but I'll be darned if I still didn't get a ""hope high"".

My best friend lost his girlfriend to suicide, and he was the one to find her at 15 and read the letter she left. It broke him so deeply in a way I couldn't explain, but he isn't as beat up about it anymore. He still loves her and misses her, has nightmares once in awhile, but he pulled through. He laughs, games, has good gaming friends and relationships, he even recently decided to pursue his passion of cooking with a little nudge from me. The reason I mention his story is to show you that the loss of your girlfriend is likely the worst thing you've ever felt, but it can be overcome if you're determined.

Even though I'm a stranger, I care about any other stranger with a mental health issue, life hardships, anything that causes them to feel helpless. Keep fighting, keep trying, life is important and you never know where it might take you.",2,ToastMe
"You cannot control what happened already, simply keep moving forward. Your family is misguided and clearly couldn’t or refused to see you as the great person you are. Don’t let them get to you, it’s what they want. Keep moving forward. 

I’m sorry about your girlfriend, that’s an incredibly hard situation to deal with but please don’t blame yourself for it. Grieve as long as you need but don’t blame yourself for it. The fact that you’re still standing proves you’re strong. 

Don’t give up hope yet. Everything may seem like it’s falling apart around you but there’s always a light at the end of the tunnel. It may seem hard now but you’re strong. You seem so kind and caring and I’m sure there’s better things up ahead. I’m sorry you’re dealing with this it’s truly awful.

"I grew up in a ""family"" where my parents divorced when i was about 6 month old and then went on to start new families. Both of my parents spent their entire lives telling me that having children too young will screw up your whole life. It didn't take me long to figure out that they felt like i screwed up their lives. And then they expected me to act like both of my families were normal families despite the fact that having 2 families wasn't normal at all at the time... i've had depression issues my entire life. It's so hard to keep finding reasons to believe that things will get better, that's it's worth getting out of bed. But you keep doing it and for that i toast you!... i've been suicidal for as long as i can remember. I'm 35 now though and am finally starting to see my life turn around and i'm so happy to be here. Keep pushing my friend, work to improve yourself and your mental state. They say the night is darkest before the dawn, i know it's just a saying but it was so incredibly true in my case. I got to the point where i was just wearing a rope around my neck and writing suicide notes to get comfortable with the idea. I didn't do it though and i'm so happy i didn't. i hope one day you can say the same. I've been reading Tony Robbins ""awaken the giant within"" lately and find it really helpful. Good luck to you, i just really hate that people have to feel this way but i do believe most have the resources to turn it around if they live in a first-world country.",2,ToastMe

What you've been through sounds so painful and devestating. The fact that you are still fighting for your mental health is courageous and shows that despite the shitty circumstances, you have managed to recognize, on some level, your worth as a person. That's not an easy thing and you should be proud that you were wise enough to see past your family's fucked up narrative. You are obviously a brave, strong man (and adorable.)",2,ToastMe

"From one survivor to another, I want you to UNDERSTAND one thing - and REMEMBER it - and LIVE it :

It’s not your fault. 

None of that shit. Your mom died. Your GF killed herself. Your family hate you. 

Not one thing written stems from you. 

You are in control of your life. 

Instead of trying to solve these particular problems head on - I suggest, instead, you turn your back. The conversations going on in your head, trying to hypothesize situations where your prove them wrong, or if things were different - are all festering your mind with nonsense. 

You don’t get your worth from birth. You don’t get it from blood or family. You don’t get it from girlfriends or church. 

You give it to yourself. Everyday. 

Your family is toxic. They are stealing your worth to make themselves feel momentarily better at the expense of your sanity.  Extinguish those relationships like your ass is on fire. 

Family is a choice. Blood isn’t. They are your blood - but they are not your family. 

Grab ahold of your life and chase it. 

You are worth it.",2,ToastMe

I promise.",2,ToastMe
"Holy shit. Just...fuck. My heart goes out to you, friend. 💛

My mom died when I was ten which is definitely a little different, but I can’t even begin to imagine what it might have been like if I’d been outright blamed for her death by other family members, or if her death had been used as justification for my abuse. 

I blamed myself enough already, solely because I was a child and needed to attempt making some sense of things, you know? That’s atrocious, and I’m so sorry you went through it. 

You did NOT deserve it. Any of it! At all! As I’m sure you know by this point (hopefully)!

Your mom’s death was absolutely NOT your fault, you worthwhile human you! I mean, you didn’t ask to be born??!!? You had no control whatsoever over how your own birth went. Sometimes no one really has control over this sort of thing unfortunately, ultimately at least—and for fuck’s sake, you were an infant. A literal infant!

You didn’t do anything wrong, and I’m genuinely glad  that you’re here with us now. The world is better with you in it. 

“You are a child of the universe, no less than the trees and the stars; you have a right to be here.” I know it’s kind of cringey, but those are lines from “Desiderata” by Max Ehrmann that have helped me through some tough times before. I hope they can offer you a bit of comfort as well.

I’m so sorry for your recent loss on top of everything else, but I know your girlfriend would want you to live. I’m sure of it! Heck, I want you to live! We all want you to live! 

Because you deserve to overcome all of this senseless tragedy, and I know you can. You’ve made it this far! You’re strong as fuck, my dude. You can get through this, and you will.

Also, your facial hair is great! That hair color of yours is super lovely (and it’s presumably your natural color based on your eyebrows)! It all matches your equally lovely sweater very well, haha. Plus, your expression is charming! You seem cool. Hang in there.",2,ToastMe

When I saw your picture, the first thing I thought was ""wow, what a genuinely kind smile"", your eyes and your smile I think represent your kindness and your pain and I want to thank you for being here, sharing your story, cause that's so brave and I'm proud of you for being so strong. I'm new here and this is my first comment ever and right now my anxiety is telling me not to post this, but I will, cause your words and braveness touched me and I'm being brave myself right now because of you, so thank you. I really truly believe you'll be okay and you'll be very happy some day, because you deserve it!",2,ToastMe

You deserve happiness and you are worthy of a fulfilling life. You truly deserve people who genuinely care about you and want to see you flourish. I know exactly what your brain is telling you, and I won't put it into words but please understand that it isn't true.

You are not simply the ""sum of these parts"" . You are more than that. You are not now, nor have you ever been, responsible for your mother's or your girlfriend's death. It's not on you. 
These may seem/feel like insurmountable obstacles, and you may not know how to move forward. That's why you are seeking help! Good news!! You don't have to do this alone. You have an opportunity here to rewrite your script. To begin a new as exactly the person you want to be. It will take time, and certainly be a process. But you are young and have time, and so many reasons to continue.

You’re a freaking hero and in a world as crappy as this one can be, we could use all the heroes we can get. You’re precious and incredible and, for whatever it’s worth, I have faith in you. I have faith that the world is better by the mere fact that you exist in it. 

It’s fine that you need this. It’s fine that you need to hear messages of love and care for you. It sounds like the people who were supposed to give you those kinds of messages failed you and I’m sorry for that. But we’re all here and we love you and care about you. You’re a great person who’s taken all the lies and hurt and the pain that life could dish out and kept the flame alive this long. Not only that but you’ve gotten yourself help from medical professionals and you’ve sought support when you needed it. That displays a remarkable amount of self-awareness. It’s not needy or whatever that voice in the back of your head says. You’re right, you do need this. We all need love and support, especially when things are dark and it feels too much. It’s not wrong to have that need and I’m glad you reached out.

These things that happened weren’t your fault. That’s not a burden you need to carry. I know it’ll be hard to do, and it’s alright if it takes time to, but you’ve got to take that weight off yourself. The circumstances suck and are terrible, but they are not your fault.

Sometimes just starting a new non stressful part time job will introduce you to a whole new world of people.  I lived through some heavy trauma and did just this and it worked. I was frightened at first but i tried to not think too much and just show up. 

You have a like able face, get out of the hell your living in and give yourself a chance! Your mom will be proud!

"Hey man that's really really tough shit you've been going through :( 

I'm really glad to hear that you've chosen to stick around and seek help, that can be a pretty hard step to take for us dudes for some reason (my dad and I were the last therapy hold outs in the family).

I almost tapped out a few weeks ago as well. I'm very grateful that I decided to hold on though because things have been looking up since then! 

I still have a lot of work to do and tough times are undoubtedly ahead of  you and I. But if we've made it this far then I'm certain we can handle whatever comes next no matter how difficult it is.

Now for some compliments:

\-I dig your style, where's that sweater from?

\-You look like a very authentic human, one whom everyone instantly respects and wants to be friends with.  All the bullshit you've put with throughout life has no doubt molded your spirit into one that is stronger than it would be otherwise and it will continue to get stronger as long you hold out for better days!

For me at the time I just worked and worked and didn't even give myself time to feel sad, then before you know it several years had passed. Try to find an outlet, whether it be work, exercise, whatever. Just don't ever sit alone at home with a bottle of liqour beating yourself up over things you can't change about the past. You'll get there man, just give it some time.",2,ToastMe
"Firstly, I think you are a very strong person to deal with all these events , which proves that you can keep going.  Sometimes families suck, but whatever they are blaming you for is not true. Your mom wanted you and gave you this life, so don’t waste it. It is never your fault for other people’s deaths and it’s so messed up that your family chose to blame a baby for something they couldn’t control. In all of this, you are not at fault. I’m sorry for what happened with your girlfriend but everyone’s actions only fall on themselves and their own state of mind. She succumbed to her demons (which wasn’t your fault at all), but please don’t let that happen to you.

I don’t know your situation but I would say get emotional help (which I think you mentioned in a comment) and change up your way of life. You don’t need this “family” that projected hate onto a baby. You will and can find people that respect you and treat you well. If your situation allows, maybe move somewhere else in the world, anywhere you like. 

Experience a new environment and get away from the people who wrongfully treated you horribly. Start again, meet new people and live. Please if anything, do it for your mom. She wanted a life for you, and if you don’t have the strength to change it for yourself, please change it for her. She is with you in everything, and you are literally the biggest part of her.

I am so sorry your girlfriend couldn't be here with us today. But you're still here, and somedays, that is more than enough. It's a hard road to recovering, but you can endure it.

From this day forward, I want you to know that we are in this battle together. That doesn't mean you have to talk to me about your problems or even acknowledge me. You don't owe my anything. I just want you to know I'll be checking in on you. I'm going through some shit myself and even made a plan to die on the 15th. Today I decided to call some loved ones and ask for help. We are in the same boat my dude. We will get this shit sorted and go on living a decent life. It's not impossible. People do it all the time.

Stepping out of your ""comfort zone"" to get advice from strangers is SO strong and determined. I couldn't even do that! 😄

You've got this buddy. Just wish I could give you a great big hug 😊

"aloha u/joraanger :)

i dealt with suicidal thoughts my whole life.

even checked myself into the hospital when i was 6 months pregnant because i couldnt see any other way out.

thankfully my baby girl is 3 months old now :)

the love you have recieved here in this thread is so beautiful.

got me tearing up too❤

as a new mother i totally understand how much love one has for her baby.

your mama loves you & is always with you.
believe me my friend death did not stop her from protecting you.

if you ever felt lucky to be alive
its because your mom saved u

she is STILL looking out for you :)

seeing all these strangers make her son smile is such a relief to her for she worries

understand that you both will be reunited one day. 

but not any time soon

she wants grandbabies

"I want to say so much and I don’t know what to say first, so:

1. You’re handsome and kind looking which means that at some point in your life you will have many potential partners to choose from, no matter any other factor. You can pick your butt in public. Options are limited for women around 35. 

2.  I don’t know your family, but as a parent, I feel they must be mentally ill and there’s no accounting for those actions. You can’t fix them, they probably can’t fix them, maybe doctors can’t even fix them. I’m sorry. 

3. They’ve lived their lives with hate in their hearts. That’s on them. 

4. You don’t owe them anything. But forgiving should be the goal. Not that they have to be told. But just because it’s a lot easier to keep them out of your mind and life if you are able to forget. And you can’t forget if you’re holding tight. 

5. Do something crazy. I went skydiving. Shocked my system. It seeped into every aspect of my life. I could breathe freer and life seemed to make sense. Something new that lets you connect with the earth. 

6. Therapy is great and very important but I got to the point where I had to take a step back. I cried more when I was there and i just felt like it would never end. My new mantra is “my feelings don’t matter “. Not that it’s true but it just reminds me to take a step back and look at reality. Just because I’m scared doesn’t mean there’s anything to be scared of. Just because my feelings got hurt doesn’t mean they meant to or even understand what happened. Just put aside the feelings like you put aside thoughts when you meditate. It’s just an exercise. 

7. You have to give yourself enough time to meet your partner. Be the parent you couldn’t be. Get a steady job (depending on age?)and start fostering kids or get on an adoption list. You clearly have so much love to give. So much! And so many people out there need to be loved! 

8. Most importantly. You’re too handsome to die!

This is a shitty toast but take all that therapy and self awareness and fake it til you make it. So much fucking potential!!!",2,ToastMe
"I read something recently that struck me  ""Trauma is not your fault, but healing is your responsibility."" I can see it in your face that you just want love and stability. And I can't promise you that it will happen soon, but it will happen. I've had to start healing from my trauma because I didn't want to be stepped on anymore. I don't want to hurt anymore and I owe it to myself to at least fight.. once I started fighting things started to change; it's scary as hell but I feel it'll be better in the long run.  I feel like you should do the same, because I'm gonna be selfish and say I want you to do that for yourself. Be responsible for fixing what those people couldn't so you can have a happy life, despite your struggles.

Your family took their grief out on the weakest, most vulnerable person possible. On the actual, real victim who lost their mum before they knew her.

You need to take care of yourself and be the mum (and dad) you never had. Until you essentially raise yourself, other mentally ill people will continue to gravitate towards you. You deserve happiness and you are strong enough to leave all that bullshit behind and become your own person. Think of the sort of life and relationships (romantic and otherwise) that you would like to have in the future and strive to become the person your future friends and girlfriend deserves. Most importantly, strive to build the life you deserve to have.

The pain doesn't go away, it just gets passed to those that get left behind, like what happened with your girlfriend. You are now left with the pain of that loss. You might not thing your family will care but I can guarantee that people will be devastated at your loss. If nothing else, if I find out that you carried this out, I will cry for you.

You can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends, who can become like family.",2,ToastMe
"I understand how much hurt and suffering you feel, how much you have gone through. I've had an equally painful last as you, so many similarities in our differences. I also had a very hard time coping with my past and leaned on alcohol, went to the mental hospital. It took a long time to overcome it. It took a year of being sober, in and out of the crazy bin for me to not want to die every second of every day. Being alive is so painful. There's pain, suffering and desperation on every corner. Doing it alone is even harder. Not having a family or spouse that cares is soul crushing.  I went and stayed with my best friend, my only family, and she helped me through it. I would ask if you have anyone, even one person in the world who you trust and can depend on, can you stay with them? What if you went to teen challenge and spent some time there? It's not about addiction, I'm not sure if you lean on drugs. Rather it's about getting through this tough time, creating some interpersonal connections. Humans used to be a tribe, we used to love and care for one another. Until you can care for yourself, is there anyone or anywhere you can lean on? 


One other thing that helped me as I cried myself to sleep every night, trying to talk myself out of slitting my wrists, was positive mantras. I reminded myself that I was here for my dogs and my best friend. I reminded myself that I had good attributes and told myself what if accomplish in the future. Everytime I had anxiety, about 10-15 x a day, I would go through the alphabet and for each letter I would compliment myself. You are a)awesome b) beautiful c) courageous, ECT. Slowly doing that every day 15x a day for over a year, I was able to rewire my brain to be more positive. I was able to manager my depression and anxiety at 20% of what it used to be. I hope that you learn that suffering is a human condition, but only you can decide if you're going to put yourself through more or less suffering. It may take years for you to understand that. I wish you luck.",2,ToastMe

"I have had the same issues. I know it’s really fucking hard. I’ve also been in and out of treatment for mental health, and I can honestly tell you that there is light at the end of the tunnel. Personally, I attempted suicide last year. I went in and out of inpatient facilities; so I know that inpatient sucks. At least where I went, it was a lot more like a jail than a hospital, and it was not what I needed at all. But over the summer, I went to Rogers Behavioral Heath residential, and it helped me so much. Not every treatment works for everyone. I don’t know your story, but I’m assuming you haven’t tried everything out there. Please, before you end up like I was, keep trying. I promise something out there will work.

"If done right going to the edge of suicide is incredibly freeing. In my time starring into the abyss I came to an interesting conclusion. I am completely and utterly insignificant and unnecessary to the world and anything I do wont matter, now follow me here, what that means to me is I can do or not do anything and it's not gonna change the world for better or worse, so then I should just do what makes me happy and not worry about ""am I doing what's right"" or ""am I doing what I'm suposed to"" none of that matters. What matters is are you happy and only you can make you happy. 

Cool your family sucks balls, cut them out of your life and move away. Do that with anyone that's toxic and trys to control you or bing you down in any way, you deserve to be happy and there are a lot of people in this world that wanna see you fail and be miserable because they suck. And you dont have time for that shit.

The rest of your life starts now and it can be pretty awesome if you can imagine it.

Here comes the shitty part, if you want to truly be in control of your happyness and your life then you need to not rely on others. Mostly in a monetary sence. If you can become financially stable then no one can hold shit over you. The hard part is getting out there trying and failing till you get it right.

"Dude. You know the phrase, “blood is thicker than water.”?

It’s bullshit.

Not that the intent is wrong. The phrase itself is incomplete. And it completely changed the meaning 180 degrees.

The original phrase is, “the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.”

Meaning, the relationships you choose (in that time being religious ties being the most important non-familial relationships) has more value than the relationships you have with your relatives.

The relationships you have with those who have earned your loyalty and share your values should be more important than relationships that exist because they have DNA in common. Even your mother needs to earn your love and you should have to earn hers.

"i know what you mean but in a different way. my childhood was filled with random violence and my dad saying shit like ""i bet your not gonna beat your mom with me because she'll buy you a toy later"" and that made me think i was shallow for not beating my mom. that kind of shit honestly and genuinely seeps into your heart like a tar that hardens over time and unrelentingly eats away at you. so i understand how life beating you down time and time again can make you feel, but, correct me if i am wrong, but i think you don't want to die. You want the pain to stop and dying is the only way you can see to get out at the moment. and that's just not true. the best thing you can do as of now is not give up. because giving up doesn't make the pain stop it only makes it worse. I mean, Hell, you have made it farther than me with a much worse situation (im 18)which speaks volume to your true strength as a person. and i know how it feels to get beaten and berated by those you want to trust and love. it makes you want to be accepted by everyone, again, unless you are different, but Something me and you both have to figure out is how to accept ourselves for who we are and to not depend on others to accept us. (i hoped this helped you, but if i didnt thats fine because its alright to try and fail :) )

not gonna lie i just made a lot of assumptions so ill make a second smaller paragraph just in case

Listen, I know this is gonna be hard for you to do, but maybe you should cut contact from your family. I know deep down you love them no matter what, but I can never bare to see anyone put up with anything that is mentally and physically hurting them, and the fact that they are all blaming you (and seems like you only) is the most shittiest thing a family has ever done. Even if you actually were to be a cause of death, no one should be straight up going at you for it, hell they shouldn’t be mentioning it in the first place, because anything like that can be traumatizing to a person.
I’ll try my best to not hit any sensitive nerves on this part but there’s lots more people waiting for you to meet. But it’s best you recover from everything first and then get back out there.

For them you're a reminder of her death, and that is why they're so stuck in the past. But what lies ahead, in the future, CAN be changed, if you have enough willpower. And the great thing about willpower is that it can be infinite if you want it to be. If you end your life now it is over for all the things you still care about.

And please don’t kill yourself. You have a great life ahead of you and you don’t need to take that away from yourself. And I’m being honest here, if your family is that harmful you need to take a break from them. Just don’t talk to them, go out and have fun. Find some friends and have fun and stop thinking about your past. It doesn’t matter right now and it never will matter in your whole future.

An activity to get you out of the house that can build up pieces of yourself to be proud in would do wonders for you!

I've struggled with depression off and on and contemplated suicide earlier this year. I've since found a new side project I'm loving, have started getting professional help, and I'm looking at dance lessons to start in the new year.

Make all your trials your assets by using them to lift others and watch it lift you up at the same time.  All the best to you.   You're most definitely not alone.",2,ToastMe

When you are happy to be you and you are ready to work on giving yourself the best and what you deserve, you have just unlocked one of the true keys to happiness. I experienced something like this recently, and I think you are experiencing the same. Now, keep that mindset, not just to remove bad habits, but to select people who are harmony-bringers to your life as well, and not drama magnets or trouble seekers. I’m happy that you managed to do this, but most importantly, I’m glad that you are happy about it because that is a very good sign for anyone. Now, make sure that you continue it. You are your first champion and the one that needs to safeguard your happiness and build your personal path towards it, making sure that you only accept and seek the people, the activities, and the places that will be conductive to it. Cheers 😁",2,ToastMe
Well done Missy!,2,ToastMe
2 months is awesome! My dads side of the family is full of alcoholics who have struggled with recovery so good on you for getting through these first two. Here’s hoping for many more!,2,ToastMe
"Most people won't understand. Not necessarily the same as not caring.

Either way, you're sober for yourself, not them. 2 months is actually a very impressive milestone as well. Congratulations and do something nice for yourself to celebrate, you deserve it.",2,ToastMe
Good job!!,2,ToastMe
"Hi, friend! That's huge!! I might not know you, but I'm very proud of you :) your pride in this accomplishment is more than justified. Best of luck, OP, I'm rooting for you!",2,ToastMe
"Not in your life, but sweet girl I am so proud of you.  My precious nephew overdosed last Halloween and I so wish he had the milestone you have today!  Girly you are strong and beautiful!!",2,ToastMe
"I just hit a year sober a few weekends ago, keep it up! I'm so proud of what you've already achieved and know you can keep this streak going! I promise things will only get better for you, clarity can be overwhelming at first but eventually it will settle in nicely. New friendships can be made, new doors open up for you. I'm sorry no one in your life seems to care, but don't let that make you doubt yourself, just strive to prove to them that this lifestyle choice is going to stick around and you'll be better off for it!",2,ToastMe
I would toast you more but you already seem good,2,ToastMe
"I just found out someone I deeply cared about at one point, a person that was important to who I am as a person, lost her battle with her addictions. We both started playing with the hard stuff together at 14/15. I made it out, outgrew it I guess. She couldn't. Every day since I found out I have had this gut wrenching regret for not being there for her more, being more supportive. I could've checked on her. But I didn't. I could've messaged her when she was on the up and told her I was proud of her. But I didn't. 

So I want to tell you that even though I don't know you, I see a piece of Raimee in you, and every one of you who is fighting this fight. And I am fucking proud of you every day that you make the choice to keep that shit out of your life. Make those 2 months 2 years, then turn it into 20 years. You're a beautiful soul who deserves so much more in life than what living that way has to offer. You are a fucking badass. Kicking an addiction is hard. 2 months is incredible. I care. I want to see where life takes you.",2,ToastMe
You rock !,2,ToastMe
"Congratulations!! Two months is great. Wishing you the strength and perseverance to keep it going. Hang in there, girl!!!",2,ToastMe
"You are the kind of person I would want to be friends with. You seem super cool and worth knowing. Great job on your accomplishment, and can't wait to toast you more when you accomplish even more. :)",2,ToastMe

Beautiful soul in your eyes. Keep getting those milestones!,2,ToastMe
Awesome feat!  Don't worry about what others think or feel.  What's most important is how you feel and what you think!  Keep it up!  You got this!,2,ToastMe
"Amazing! I’m proud of you! It’s not an easy thing to break the cycle but we are all counting on you. And it’s great that there is always support here when you can’t seem to find it in real life at the time! 

Rooting for you!",2,ToastMe

"Congratulations beautiful soul! You've got this. You don't need the approval or acknowledgement of others, you're not doing this for them, you're doing it for you. Lead by example and keep up the good work!",2,ToastMe
"Kicking an addiction is no easy task. Even if you do think no one in your life cares, don't worry about them. You did this for you. As long as you are proud thats all that matters. And of course, you got the whole community behind you. Heres to your good health.",2,ToastMe
I’m proud of you!,2,ToastMe
You got this!,2,ToastMe
your amazing. I’m proud of you,2,ToastMe
"I’ve got almost 10 years here. If you ever need to chat, just ping me.",2,ToastMe
Congratulations and keep up the great work!!!!!!!,2,ToastMe
"I understand this feeling. Rather than anyone saying things like ""i'm glad you've made it this far,"" or anything encouraging, I still get negative reinforcement. 


So I just don't bring it up to anyone. I do it for myself. I'm proud of you, and I know you can keep going. Keep doing it for yourself.",2,ToastMe
"Congrats! That is no easy task, keep it up. You will be tempted, so stay strong.

 Even if no one did care, which isn't true, you shouldn't assess your self worth with how others value you. Learn to love yourself.",2,ToastMe
Congrats!!!,2,ToastMe
"Great work! A toast to your hard work and dedication to choosing to help yourself! The people in your life should care, I’m sorry they don’t, but we random internet strangers are proud of you!",2,ToastMe
"No matter what kind of problem someone has, the two primary steps that most people fail at solving it is 1) admitting it, 2) committing to fixing the problem.

It's a bigger deal than you may think, and being proud is how you should feel.",2,ToastMe
"Two months is so amazing. That’s 2 months you haven’t woken up sick, 2 months with a clear mind, 2 months worth of money you saved, and most importantly 2 months of you being proud of yourself. 

Always remember how amazing you feel in this moment. It only gets better from here.",2,ToastMe
Looking good girl! So proud of you! That's insane that no one in your life cares about this accomplishment bc it is really amazing what you have accomplished!,2,ToastMe
Holy crap! I'm SO proud of you and you deserve all the recognition in the world!,2,ToastMe
"  That’s amazing! You did it! Please do something to celebrate. If you do not have money to spend then just do something nice at home, like light candles & take a bath, or cook a nice dinner. Keep going! You are so strong & amazing, & you got this! We are all rooting for you. I have been through this & I know how hard it is every day. Message me if you ever need to talk.",2,ToastMe
I don’t think it gets much simpler than this: You go girl! 💯,2,ToastMe

Take some well earned kudos from this internet stranger!",2,ToastMe
"Congrats! I know what you mean, when I hit a year off opiates I thought people would recognize it and remember and at least say “I’m proud of you!” or something to that effect, but in the end it was the choices I made that put me on that road and I had no one to blame but myself despite how hard it was to make it to a year. Still opiate free since 07/18. If you ever need a sounding board feel free to msg (that goes for anyone)",2,ToastMe

I’m so fucking proud of you girllllll!!!! Way to kick addiction in the ass. For real though it’s definitely the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. It’s an every day struggle and having 60 days is an amazing feeling. Keep on putting in the work!!! You got this love. Congrats :),2,ToastMe

"I care! I’m so proud of you! Sometimes when you make big changes in your life, the people closest to you don’t know what to do with it. Some of them may feel like they’re being left behind and may they should be. In my experience I had to leave people behind to get better.

Just know there are a ton of people you don’t even know that are rooting for you! Congratulations! 🤗❤️",2,ToastMe

"2 months is when it starts to get reeeeally hard! You can message me anytime, i was a heroin addict for years. I got your back! Keep going to the meetings, keep trying to stay positive even when you have the most boring people rambling at AA. Sometimes it all seems cheesy and too religious but it does work so.. stick to it! 

Also, You are so gorgeous, your face is perfect! Those lips are to die for, your hair looks healthy, your eyes are pretty af, and i can just tell you have a beautiful soul. You seem creative too! Idk if you paint or draw but maybe you should try it (: you’re incredibly brave for getting help and trying to be better. Its so hard. 

GOOD LUCK AND NEVER GIVE UP!",2,ToastMe
"Great job! Keep it up, people care!",2,ToastMe
"Good job! You’re not alone in that feeling. At two months people are still not quite ready to give a pat on the back. I went through the same thing. I wanted recognition for how good I was doing, but got nothing. I had to come to terms that It took years to fuck it up, so I wasn’t to get it back right off. Stay sober for yourself, and everything will come together for you. That’s a promise.",2,ToastMe
Proud of you!,2,ToastMe
You are powerful!! Thanks for the inspiration :),2,ToastMe

Congratulations on your 2 month chip!!!!  Awesome!!!!  Keep working your program!!!!,2,ToastMe
"I lost my aunt, sister, mother and father all to various complications due to alcoholism. When I see people who can overcome that shit, who work so hard to save themselves and have found the ability to pick themselves up when they fall down it means so much to me.   


Also, just a note, but a lot of times when people are in active addiction their environment and those in it feed that addiction. That's why AA talks about changing people, places and things. It might be that they see you changing and have to take a hard look at themselves and they don't like that. And they'll try to bring you down because of that. Don't let them. Grow, change, do better, do it for you, do it for those who aren't ready yet and who might walk in the door after you have a year of recovery in you and who will need your guidance at that time. You are a beacon, carry the light, carry the hope, carry your story. You matter. Don't let other people tell you that you don't (or even act subconciously like you don't). Thank you for sharing your experience, strength and hope with so many!",2,ToastMe
You have made it two months. Congratualations!!!!!! That is amazing. You deserve all sorts of credit. Keep up the good work!,2,ToastMe

Congrats:) very happy for you. That’s amazing and I’m sure others do care they just don’t express it,2,ToastMe
Anytime you need a pick me up message me or text me. You’re amazing. And that’s open for anyone.,2,ToastMe
Woohoo! Huge and life changing accomplishment! Your family might need time to get invested in your sobriety if your trust with them was broken - but they'll come around. You DID this. You should be proud!,2,ToastMe
You are doing an amazing thing! I'm currently over 5 years clean from alcohol and have just passed my first year clean from weed - my life is now SO MUCH BETTER than I ever could have imagined. Recovery begins with both a decision to change and then taking the first few steps away from a familiar and destructive path - those are the 2 hardest parts and you've already done them - now take every single minute clean as a victory and enjoy exploring your new found freedom!!! All the best! X,2,ToastMe
"That is so absolutely amazing,  I'm so sooo proud of you!",2,ToastMe
"Congrats! Welcome to the rest of your life! You look good and sound happy so keep the right attitude and you’ll rock this. As a former opiate user, i get how tough it is. Just surround yourself with positivity, it does wonders in keeping the on the path ;).",2,ToastMe
Fuck yeah! You’re so beautiful and so strong. Good for you.,2,ToastMe
Awesome!! Keep moving forward!! The people in your life that love you will get closer as time passes and trust is built again. <3,2,ToastMe
"Sobriety is tough! Every time you have a good day, every time you take a step forward, each new chip... I hope you get to really soak that in. You earned the hell out of it.
Conversely, you may have to live in some bad days as well, but you didn't ""earn"" those. Your brain chemistry went rogue on you, and you didn't choose that, and now you're fighting it.
You're using your brain to fight your brain!!! That's the trickiest shit in the world! It's amazing! Congrats!!",2,ToastMe
I really like your handwriting,2,ToastMe

"It’s amazing that you’ve stayed committed to turning a new leaf. I’m sure it’s not easy, so congratulations.",2,ToastMe
"Youre amazing! Keep it up. Maybe the people in your life just dont understand, it may not be that they arent actuallly proud. They just may not understand the disease of addiction and think this is just how you SHOULD be. There are millions of people that do understand and are proud of you, I promise you that.",2,ToastMe
"Even if nobody cares in your life, that you are sober which, by the way, is patently false, we still do!",2,ToastMe
Proud of you..stay focused,2,ToastMe
"Just remember, you’re not doing this for everyone else. You’re doing it for you, so even if you feel like nobody cares, shake that shit off and remember you are doing it for YOU and nobody else. 

Congratulations on your successful sobriety! Keep at it. I know it’s a struggle some days but you have beaten it for 2 solid months, so why not keep on keepin’ on.",2,ToastMe
"I'm so proud of you! Know that I'm rooting for you, and that great things are in your future!",2,ToastMe
You’re doing it! Congrats! Awesome job!!!! You got this!!,2,ToastMe
Congratulations!,2,ToastMe
Yes! Yes! Yes! 2 months is an awesome milestone! No one cares? Future you is proud of today’s sacrifices!,2,ToastMe
"That’s because they don’t TRULY understand what you’re going through. Addiction is baffling to those that don’t suffer from it. I’m sure they’re proud of you, but the truth is they’ll probably never fully understand (unless they become an addict, so let’s hope they don’t). Stay strong!",2,ToastMe
Dude good work! Lord knows it’s not easy.,2,ToastMe
You’re fuckin awesome,2,ToastMe
"Congratulations! Your complexion is so clear, too! That’s worth celebrating, also! Haha",2,ToastMe
Keep coming back.,2,ToastMe
Congrats! I'm proud of you and there are more good things in your future.,2,ToastMe
"I am proud of you! I watched my dad have 3 years sober, twice, and then finally it stuck. I was proud of him and I’m proud of you. When he died he had more than 16 years sober. Those years were a gift. I saw how hard he worked at it and how much time he put into it. I’m proud of you and you certainly deserve to be proud of yourself!",2,ToastMe
"Oof, I cared a bunch even before you mentioned nobody did. Congrats. Also, you are beautiful.",2,ToastMe
"Congratulations! That takes a lot of willpower and hard work. Great job and keep it up!

This is much less important, but I like your nail polish. I went with black today, too. :)",2,ToastMe
Oh my god you are a fucking catch.,2,ToastMe

"Screw it, go for it. You got only one life. The mug looks absolutely beautiful. You got this girl 👌",2,ToastMe
"Everyone chooses practical things!! When every third person is a lawyer and you’re the only one who can make ceramics, you’ll be laughing!!! Great choice and great mug 💖💖",2,ToastMe
ugo”someone’sgottamakethecoffeecups”gurl,2,ToastMe
"That mug is GORGEOUS! Don't feel bad - you're doing something you're talented at and you love, and you'll make others happy by providing them with beautiful ceramics. I think you're very wise to follow your love, it will lead to a fulfilling life. You're also super cute! Your eyes are so warm.",2,ToastMe
"I love the mug, and I love that you loved making the mug!

Not sure if this is covered in your degree program, or if it would be relatively easy to get into with a ceramics background, but how do you feel about also getting trained in glassblowing? There's a decent demand for that, at least in sciences.",2,ToastMe
"I think you made a good choice getting a degree in something that you love. I hope you can find a way to be successful in your field. But even if you don’t and you have to get a job unrelated to your degree you should still cherish your time doing what you love and maybe you can sell your mugs as a side gig.

I’m doing a degree in mathematics and in my country it’s generally looked down upon, especially since I could have studied medicine or engineering (literally the only “respectable” majors in society’s eyes where I live). I’ve heard all kinds of comments and spent a long time second guessing my choice but now I wouldn’t change it for anything. I really hope you can find the confidence in your choice of your field.

Also you look gorgeous and that mug is beautiful!",2,ToastMe
Cool mug. Do what the fuck you like. You’ll look back on this fondly one day for sure,2,ToastMe
"I’m a music major and there are still days I feel shitty about that choice considering my entire family have “useful” degrees and my sister landed a high paying job with her math degree, but I’m far happier than she was in school because I’m doing what I love. It can seem like a bad idea sometimes because of societal standards but I urge you to stick to your guns and study the thing you love, it’ll be so worth it and everything will work out I promise :)",2,ToastMe
I’d buy the hell out of that mug. Beautiful work you’ve done.,2,ToastMe
"You should just do what you enjoy, also you can actually make a career out of ceramics, so it's a good choice. You seem very talented :)",2,ToastMe
How much are you selling them for? I'd by one,2,ToastMe
"First of all, your hair is epic and amazing and I want to know how you do that magic. Second, I majored in Art in college and have zero regrets. The main thing is just to GO to college and graduate in good standing. I work in a non-art-related field, I got my masters in social work, and I did not feel behind those peers who got a BA in SW before seeking a masters. In fact I felt grateful for enjoying a creative education before “buckling down”, and I definitely use my art in numerous ways in my life and work. Unless you’ve been 100% sure of your career track since childhood, you have the time to explore what feels right to you! Who knows what doors it will open!",2,ToastMe
"It takes time to convert your passion to income. You could start a YouTube channel showing how you make your stuff, then sell it online. Maybe it would be a part time income at first, then transition to full time.",2,ToastMe
Nice mug,2,ToastMe
"You’re making a good call! My dad always told me that college isn’t for figuring out a career, it’s for finding something you’re passionate about and diving in.

I got a music degree, and while I only make a small portion of my income in music, I would make the same decision again. I have a job to make my living, but music makes my life. No matter what, you’ll have your art",2,ToastMe
"I picked a degree that I thought would be good for money. Worst mistake of my LIFE. I work in a completely different field now thankfully. College/uni is all dependent on what you do with it. If you love what you do at college then you'll take that over into your working life. Art is hard to get into, everyone knows that, but you can make a business off it, work for someone else, do freelance and supplement it with part time work. If that mug is anything to go by you'll do incredible thing with your work. I wish you all the best!",2,ToastMe
"Seriously, that mug is amazing! I have one made by someone near me that is one of my favourite possessions. Won’t have my tea or coffee without it. 

There’s value in skills and abilities even when it’s harder to monetize. In whatever capacity you’re able to move forward with it, people will treasure your work.",2,ToastMe
"I always wanted a career in ceramics, went a different route completely. Follow your dreams, love what you do and be proud of yourself.",2,ToastMe
"You took a step towards private ownership of an entrepreneurial business!! Online sales...kiosk at the fair...the mall...doing what you LOVE!!!
I see no downside,  it's all about marketing your art!!!   AAAND, IT'S USEFUL!!!!",2,ToastMe
"Oh, that's a nice mug!",2,ToastMe
i would gladly buy a mug from you,2,ToastMe
"Omg, I love that mug so much! It reminds me of other mugs and ceramics that they sell in my hometown. Also, your hair is absolutely amazing!",2,ToastMe
"We gotta get rid of the stigma that creative or
Artistic jobs don’t have feasible career fields!! You are so talented!! And will definitely go far 🥰",2,ToastMe
"Do whatever the fuck makes you happy, and provided it doesn't harm anyone else, fuck anyone telling you different.",2,ToastMe
"People less talented than you have made a living out of something even less practical than ceramics. Follow your heart, know your worth and explore. Maybe this degree gets you international recognition as a world class ceramicist (?or maybe you use the degree to teach underprivileged kids a new skill, or maybe you never use your degree but the contacts you made in school later lead to an even better opportunity. Your path doesn’t have to be linear to be valid. Go forth and ceramicicize!",2,ToastMe
"Getting a degree at all shows initiative, and most people don't get jobs in their field of study. 

Recognizing it wasn't a good degree to get is the first step, but that doesn't mean it's worthless!

Etsy it up!",2,ToastMe
"I received a scholarship to an art school, and I kick myself every day still 18 years later for not following my passion. If you can make it work for you, why shouldn't you do something you absolutely love?  Being happy with what you do is a huge gift, and only a dream for some. Congrats and good luck, the mug is amazing!",2,ToastMe
Can I buy that mug? It’s beautiful! With that much talent I’m glad that you chose it over a typical major!,2,ToastMe
"You do what you want in life. 

I happen to love electrical engineering, I'm good at it, and I haven't had stable work in 20 years.  There aren't any guarantees in life about making money or having a stable income, so you should be proud of what you love doing, and do it well. 

Really cool mug.  It would be my favorite if I had it.",2,ToastMe
"All I have to say is hustle your ass off, and network! Be very engaged in your local art community and also pursue other artistic endeavors. Please do these things. Do it until it hurts and it makes you cry. Do it to the point where you'll break one of those mugs over someone's head.

In this world that passion separates successful artist and average Joe's who leave the scene.

There are some artist who have other passions. I use to be a graphic designer and illustrator for an awesome magazine. I took a part time job working in aerospace on the weekends because I loved aviation since I was a kid. I got a taste for it on the weekends and today I touch an aircraft everyday. :)",2,ToastMe
"doing what you love just means having to work hard and commit yourself to your passion. One of the most amazing days I ever had was firing a set of pots and doing the raku treatment upon exit. Never thought something so beautiful could come from such chaos, flame and outright danger.",2,ToastMe
"you totally made the right choice! and this is coming from someone who studied art history, possibly even more “useless” than ceramics. you can start your own business and be your own boss! Sure you might have to have a day job for a while but it’ll all work out in the end",2,ToastMe
How about that mug is gorgeous and I know folks who would want to buy it and who would treasure it.,2,ToastMe
"For the love of all that is good and holy, PLEASE stick with something you love and are passionate about. I started in Computer Science, but was going to switch to Psychology because I love it. But everyone told me not to. Now, I have been in the IT field for 6 years, and hate it, and lo and behold, back in school to chase something I actually care about, racking up even more debt, feeling like I wasted years of my life. 

&#x200B;

You are amazing at this, clearly, and its likely that this skill is more practical than you think. I bet every person you know owns some cute dishware, vases, mugs, models, etc. Decoration and household items are always a commonly sought after thing. Keep it up, if you are really worried, maybe try taking some online classes for certifications in other things alongside what you love. Regardless, don't give up, please, keep doing the amazing work you are doing!",2,ToastMe
As I was scrolling I went ‘ooh that’s a beautiful mug!’ before I read your headline.  I think you have some talent there lady.,2,ToastMe
"yOUR MUG! It hasthesame shape as my current favourite mug, and it is always in the wash. Is it possible to buy one from you, and have it shipped to me?

Btw, continue doing what you love. There isn't any point in living a boring life where you dread gjetting up in the morning. Keep it up, and put yourself out there, you'll get by just fine. ❤️",2,ToastMe
Do you sell them?? I'm looking for ceramics for my new apartment!,2,ToastMe
Keep at your passion! You got this!,2,ToastMe
That is the most Beautiful mug I have ever seen *-* I'm really into crafting and glazed clay so seeing a mug that pleases both makes my day a little better. Thank you very much <3,2,ToastMe
"Holy shit, that's really damn good. 

You could show these off to a few places and most definitely make some good money selling them things. Craigslist would probably be a good idea too. 

Honestly though, always follow your passion. Anything else will just make life boring

I'm just still in awe at how good that mug is, your very good with your hands",2,ToastMe
So I’ll do ya one better. Please PM me with details on how to purchase one of your creations?,2,ToastMe
"beautiful! also, if you can make ceramics your minor and something ""more practical"" your major(s), maybe look into that",2,ToastMe
Key to success isn’t the path you choose it’s how hard you work at the path you’ve chosen.,2,ToastMe
"Fuck practical, do what makes you happy. If it ends up having to changing the plan to a hobby, still pursue it. Go for your dreams girl. You seem to have an excellent talent here. Also youre very beautiful to.",2,ToastMe
"Im a coffeemug breaking specialist. 
You like to make mugs. 

Take you out for dinner maybe? ;)",2,ToastMe
"I just started a ceramics course! My teacher is a wonderful lady who studied ceramics and has been working in that business for over 29 years! 

It may not be the most lucrative business, but if you love it..  
To add some positive notes: 

Practiced all over the world

Could potentially get a job anywhere

Can work from home if you invest in a set up!

Could work with an awesome collective

Can teach all over the world

Your plants will rock those pots!

Edit: on mobile, format didn't make sense",2,ToastMe
That really is a nice mug. Be proud of what you have accomplished and what you are accomplishing. Happiness goes a long way...,2,ToastMe
"The ability to make something IS practical. Especially something beautiful. Congratulations on learning and perfecting a REAL SKILL while tons of us stare at spreadsheets and send emails all day.

You’ll figure out the money side of the equation, and in the end, if you love what you’re doing, you’re taking the right path!!",2,ToastMe
"The mug looks very nice, and while I personally don't have much interest in pottery I applaud people who follow their dreams. In terms of practicality, you could make quite alot of money selling your craft as people will never loose their need for cups and plates lol. I'm sure it will work out since you seem to be good at your job.

Best of luck for you and your future :)",2,ToastMe
"I decided to post about the bug before reading the headline!

It's gorgeous! Would impulse buy for sure.

Great hair too!",2,ToastMe
"You should get a practical education in something useful for your craft, like business or accounting. Work somewhere, get experience in how business works, then strike out on your own when you identify a market opportunity. You’ll have a safety net and a way to be marketable in the business world.",2,ToastMe
"My cousin is a ceramics master, and while she doesn't make enough to live of it (she works in a supermarket part time, and sells her ceramics on markets and such), she absolutely loves the life she has. She lives with other creative people and there is always someone to try out ideas or talk about work or things or just cook together after work. So even if you don't necessarily work making ceramics for the rest of your life, it can be a good thing for your personal growth or development as a person.

But on a toastier note, I love your hair, and that mug is absolutely lovely. Do you have an etsy or something?",2,ToastMe
Picasso made great ceramics that top auction houses love to sell.  It’s more important to aim high and hit the target than to worry about what kind of arrow you’re shooting.,2,ToastMe
"I don’t know how related this is to you, but ceramics have a lot of engineering applications, expertise in which can lead to big bucks.",2,ToastMe
"If you are good in whatever you do, you WILL have a secure future. Just keep on learning and you knowledge will start opening doors",2,ToastMe
Where do I buy one?,2,ToastMe
"Chose a course in something you love and a masters in something that'll make you money. 

If ceramics is what you love then it's what you should do. Worst case scenario then just move to Vietnam and teach English or something.",2,ToastMe
"I actually think that's is a pretty practical degree!! One of my favourite places I went as a kid growing up was a ceramics shop where you could make, paint, or learn about ceramics. If you decide to start you own business, I'm sure you'll do very well, not to mention theres a good demand for it and very little supply, so chances are with the right location, it could turn profit within the first year or so :)

Edit: if you do decide to pursue entrepreneurship, I highly reccomend taking as many courses in it and business as you can. They are very helpful.",2,ToastMe
I feel exactly the same after I got my BFA in illustration. These comments are very affirming. Thank you.,2,ToastMe
"Okay listen that is a bomb ass mug! Super cute. Use your creativity and passion to pave your own way and don’t apologize for following your dreams! We have enough unhappy people stuck doing something they hate.Taking the road most traveled is boring anyway, and I bet tons of people would buy your ceramics. I know I’m a sucker for handmade things :)",2,ToastMe
Can I buy pls.,2,ToastMe
"If society ever falls apart your skills will be highly needed.  If society doesn’t, you can still carve out a career doing something you love and not many of us can say that.",2,ToastMe
Those are my most favorite kind of mugs. So beautiful! Keep doing what you love!,2,ToastMe
"You sound a little like me. Have faith! My major was history, thirty years later over a long and interesting road, I’m a technical manager (no technical degree). It’s an advantage to think a little differently than many other colleagues. You have that potential, too. You might feel better if you just don’t assume your major equals your career. Think outside the box when you look for a job, and have faith in yourself! I bet you end up having a good, strange road that you’ll be happy with at the end. Plus a nice biz or side hustle in what you love.",2,ToastMe
"Can I buy your mugs? Please come to Maryland, USA xoxo",2,ToastMe
"This is exactly what everyone wishes they’ve done if they start with something practical. My dad always forced me to take practical classes through high school, and when it came time to pick something I loved as a college major I wasn’t even really sure what that was or didn’t have the skills I needed to get into a program I wanted to. After switching my major a shit ton, and racking up more and more debt, i landed on psychology with no intention on going back to school. Now I have a useless degree and haven’t cultivated my skills when it comes to ANYTHING I love. It’s just sad and I feel like I wasted my life. So yes, you made the right decision.",2,ToastMe
"I took a degree in cybersecurity, and I work in computers daily, but I honestly hate it. I would rather have a degree in botany or something and just grow plants and cook with what I grow, make beautiful gardens for people etc. So it is always better to go with your interests rather than what you think will provide the most for you. At least from my perspective. Plus as I have seen suggested, make a business out of it, your work looks great!",2,ToastMe
At the end of the day most jobs only require you to have a degree....so what it is in is irrelevant for 75% of the places that are hiring! Be happy you were willing to choose something you are passionate about!!!,2,ToastMe
"People said the same thing about me when I chose black smithing, you do what makes you happy. It's super cool, I haven't seen anyone who works in ceramics, so that's awesome!",2,ToastMe
"I love your curly hair it looks so pretty! The mug looks amazing and cute too, I love the blue / brown combo! Is there a specific style that's called so I can buy something like it? Do you take commissions or something for mugs? I'd love to have a set like that.",2,ToastMe
"Just saying, I've seen much worse sold for way more than it should've been, so even if you don't think it's practical, you'll definitely be living well",2,ToastMe
I’ve been in my career for almost twenty years and I hate it. Do something that you love. Otherwise you’ll have tons of regrets and you won’t be fulfilled. Good luck!!,2,ToastMe
Time to double down in useless degrees and get an MFA. Currently on my 3rd art degree.,2,ToastMe
"If that mug is a product of the skills from your course, I guess it's safe to say that you have learnt something quite practical. And in fact, it won't be hard to capitalize your skills in our ages.",2,ToastMe
I personally have a lot of respect for someone who chooses to follow their passion. It takes a lot of guts to know that you're going to go down a really tough but personally rewarding road in life. It really takes a lot of character to make that decision. I wish you the all of the luck and success that you deserve! The mug is beautiful!,2,ToastMe
"Do what you love, in the long run that's far more practical. I love the mug and would die for you hair and gorgeous skin 🧡",2,ToastMe
"Before I even opened the post and realized the mug was relevant to it, I was thinking, “omg that mug is gorgeous - would it be a jerk move to ask where she got it? I want one!” I am so impressed you made it. The shape is perfect, the handle has the most pleasing swoop, and the color combo is my absolute favorite EVER. Not even kidding. I have a mug in a very similar color scheme but a less enjoyable shape. I have been actively keeping an eye out for one just like yours. I would buy that - and a back-up, to boot - in a heartbeat. I’m torn between being so impressed that you made it, and sad that it ISN’T a product for sale somewhere! 

You have real skill, not to mention a killer artistic eye. Best of luck to you in pursuing ceramics!",2,ToastMe
Brah that mug is fire. Keep doing what you love practicality is for the birds,2,ToastMe
"Beautiful ceramic pieces bring a lot of joy to a lot of people. As far as I’m concerned, the business of joy is a good one to get into ❤️",2,ToastMe
"Fuck practicality. We’re all gonna die anyways. 


Cute mug I’d totally buy it.",2,ToastMe
Nice work OP!! Beautiful creation!😀🙌🏻,2,ToastMe
Fuck being rich. Aslong as u can make a living that's all that matters. Status and material shit doesnt make you happy. Loved ones and laughs make u happy. Good luck ! Ur cup looks dope btw.,2,ToastMe
Do you sell those mugs? I’d love one of them. Makes me think of Christmas. :p,2,ToastMe
"Hey you do whatever you please! Especially with that beautiful mug ;) I know way to many people not using their 4 year business degree’s and serving to make a living. I don’t think the degree matters, just depends how driven you are :)",2,ToastMe
"You made an okay choice. Also, if you did a 180°and chose a more “practical” career because it felt more comfortable, that would also be an okay choice.",2,ToastMe
"No joke we need better dishes in this world. Im sick of eating and drinking from plastic. In a time where everything is cheap garbage, we need more passionate artists. You will make the world a better place with your love. What's more practical than a drinking vessel anyway? Mugs make the world go 'round!",2,ToastMe
I majored in art and make a really good living. It’s all in what you do with your education. Beautiful mug!!,2,ToastMe
"From someone who went to theatre school, you're making the right choice!  Despite the loans, the difficulty of landing gigs, the pressure to get a ""real job"" I've never truly regretted going to school for what I love. And although school was not perfect by any means itself I still wouldn't give it up. Lots of great people, great experiences, and training in something I'm passionate about. 

You're doing great, OP! I hope you'll show us some more of your awesome work in the future :)",2,ToastMe
"Listen, that is probably one of the upcoming crazy trends, and that mug looks amazing, and you will probably be one of the leading businesses in the industry. So, patience is everything. And trust me, I would definitely get loads of them right now.",2,ToastMe
You definitely shouldn't feel shitty about choosing to what you what love! Especially when you're this good. I know my S/O and I would love your work in our home selection. You're gonna start living your dream soon and so many people will envy you for it because they chose something practical. You got this!,2,ToastMe
"Whether it's making ceramics or a stranger's day, keep going forward! You're killing it!",2,ToastMe
My MIL would buy the shit out of that mug.,2,ToastMe
"I was once in the position of choosing pottery or engineering. I felt pressure and chose engineering, I spent 8 years in college because I didn't choose what I was passionate about. Didnt event get a engineering degree, ended up working in horticulture for vegetables. Good on you for doing it! The biggest influence in my life was my high school pottery teacher, you have a lot of life to share your passions with others. Enjoy it!",2,ToastMe
3 words. Cambridge satchel company. Stick to it 👍🏾❤️,2,ToastMe
"That mug is beautiful! You clearly have the talent and skill pieces locked down, now make sure you also take some business and marketing courses. Study digital marketing, how to build and engage your audience, etc. You're an artist, now you just have to build a business and get your art out to the world!",2,ToastMe
"The coffee cup is beautiful. You've found your calling so do it, and your hair is so amazing omg.",2,ToastMe
"You’re gorgeous, so go create more beauty in the world.",2,ToastMe
"My dad has been a working potter for 30 years and raised three kids doing it. He works hard, long hours (gotta make lots of mugs to pay rent), but he wouldn't change it. And he set a great example for me and my sibs that it's ok to go for your passion even if it's not ""practical."" 

Also, nice mug!",2,ToastMe
"As long as you don’t expect money out of it, it’s the best choice you can make. I chose passion (becoming a chef) over making cash and I couldn’t be happier. I’m sure it’ll be the same for you!",2,ToastMe
"To quote the legendary Robin Williams'

 ""We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for.""

Don't feel bad or self-conscious about the fact that you may not have a ""Practical Degree"" doesn't mean its not worth doing and having in our world, art is an incredible method of human expression and inspires people on a daily basis.",2,ToastMe
I wish you every success! You might already know this but do get in touch with local restaurants/chefs to do custom dinnerware for restaurants. It might not be the most creative outlet but a little pocket change doesn't hurt!,2,ToastMe
Doing something you love is far more satisfying than just doing something for the sake of doing something. Your reward is far greater with something you love to do. I've been at jobs where the only thing on my mind is leaving work... That's exhausting and even seems like punishment. Congrats on doing and choosing to do that which you love doing,2,ToastMe
"You have such a bright,  beautiful face, I love your work,  please keep it up, best of luck to you",2,ToastMe
"Take a couple business classes, and open your own store. Good luck",2,ToastMe
"I would definitely buy that mug, it's wonderful!",2,ToastMe
"Honey, do what you love!!! I went to college for something practical and ended up hating it. Now I’m in a field I like so much better and I’m being trained on the spot and given opportunities to take classes and get national certifications. You are a beautiful soul, don’t waste your life doing something for the money. (Do it because you get satisfaction out of it)",2,ToastMe
Ceramics is practical. Lol. People need dishes to eat off of and cups to drink out of. That mug I freaking like. Now if you were to make a Set of that with dishes and saucers that would sell easily.,2,ToastMe
Beautiful mug! Just FYI your career doesn't have to be tied to your degree subject forever. I know a guy who majored in art history and now works as a successful systems engineer :),2,ToastMe

I didn’t have a choice because of my parents and I’m doing something practical I hate and barely passing classes instead of something I love (art). You chose a good path. Always do what you love. Art is important! Ceramics is really really cool. Good luck in your future.,2,ToastMe
"Shit let’s make it practical, I’ll buy a mug of yours.",2,ToastMe
Dude can I buy one?,2,ToastMe
"Practice your raku, stat! Get it!",2,ToastMe
"The best thing about a ceramics degree is that is has varying levels of practicality!!! This hit the front page so I'm sure your inbox has been overflowing with new messages all day. But I wish you a lifetime of making practical ceramics for everyday use, and always enjoying the endless possibilities of impractical creativity, mistakes, and successes. Always keep creating!! Never give up!!",2,ToastMe
"I love that mug! I have a problem buying too many, but I'd definitely buy that one. It looks like it fits so nicely for small hands (like mine) and I love the glaze so much!",2,ToastMe
Dude that’s a gorgeouas piece that you made. Fr if I saw it in a store i would hesitate to even check the price cuz a mug that nice would probably be really expensive. You have a real talent and you’re going to bring a lot of joy to people with your ceramics. Thank u for making the decision to share it with the world.,2,ToastMe
"You create art! Ceramics is the craft of creating usable art as opposed to something that has no function but being aesthetically pleasing. You've not only made the right choice, you've chosen a path of joy. That is a wise decision. Also please show us more of your work? I love how your mug looks.",2,ToastMe
The blue drippy design on that mug reminds me of the forest spirit when it’s going all insane at the end of Princess Mononoke. It’s very cool.,2,ToastMe

I wish I could get my hair to do what yours does! perfection 😉,2,ToastMe
That's the kind of mug I could see a lot of people using. I see myself using it and you definitely have a lot of talent. You could probably turn what you love into a career!,2,ToastMe
Mug looks pretty but you look prettier!!,2,ToastMe

"You're supporting an important sector! Skills like those are dying out, our world needs more ceramicist!",2,ToastMe
Ugh you’re gorgeous.,2,ToastMe
"That is a gorgeous mug!

I know nothing about ceramics degrees, but a lot of degrees you can use in the most surprising places. 

Maybe you could make pottery that mirrors historical pieces for a museum for either reinactments or sales. Maybe you could do sculptures. Maybe there is an epic pottery company near you that you can work at or design for. Maybe you could design dishes and mug lines for Ikea. 

If you love it, start knocking down those doors to find a good fit for yourself. ❤",2,ToastMe
"Define practical.

You can make attractive cookware and dining wares and sell for bucketloads.

If ""usefulness"" isn't your forte, there's also art which again sells for bucketloads.

If making money isn't what you're after, the act of throwing clay is therapeutic and beneficial to your mental health (and if you teach others, you will also be a huge boon to *their* mental health *and* be passing on a cool skill).

You don't need to justify your choice in degree. At the end of the day, it's just a piece of paper. If you're happy with what you do then forget what any naysayer says.",2,ToastMe
That mug is kickass! Choosing a career because you feel like it’s what you should do will never turn out great in the end. What’s money if you are miserable with no free time? You could open your own Etsy shop and sell your mugs! Make an Instagram! Just a bit of marketing and you could be as if not more successful than if you just took that office job. Go live your dreams lady!,2,ToastMe
I would buy that mug.,2,ToastMe
"Okay I’m gonna be very cynical. Do what makes you happy. Reach for the stars. Are you capable of making this a career? Ya sure! Just don’t be sad if you don’t make great money, have stability in the future, and don’t find a job. Could you have all those things? Yes. Is it much harder with your degree? Yeah.",2,ToastMe
You got this forsure.. Id buy that mug! Just keep at it and push forward cant go wrong,2,ToastMe
People focus way to much on a boring 9-5 just to survive. Good on you for choosing to take a risk and not just be someone’s employee for the rest of your life. Like your actually creating art that serves a practical purpose(or at least that mug seems pretty practical 😊. The only times you realize your worried is because your taking a risk and doing something exciting. I’d rather live that way than just merely waking working and sleeping,2,ToastMe
That mug is gorgeous... both the one on your face  and the one in your hand.  You're doing great.,2,ToastMe

"Honestly tho, that's a pretty fricken cool mug.",2,ToastMe
Practical is relative. Go somewhere with a low cost of living and no/few local ceramicists. Work somewhere nice but entry level and throw clay on the side. That's an awesome mug. Can I see more of your work?,2,ToastMe
That mug is beautiful. Trust me OP follow what you love. You’ll get better as you go no matter how good you already are. On top of that even if you just barely make enough to live you’re gonna love that a lot more than working a dead end job doing the same thing.,2,ToastMe
That’s a beautiful mug!!,2,ToastMe
That's a sweet mug... Gimme,2,ToastMe
"You ever walk into one of those kitschy little stores? Mugs like that arent cheap so yeah, I'd say if it is your passion and you continue to persue it then it is not at all a waste. It is only a waste if you waste your skill by not using it. 

And frankly even then it is something you love that brings you joy. Your definition of success doesnt have to match other peoples definitions. On top of that you get ONE life. The more of that time that you spend happy the better so is any time you're happy ever really wasted?",2,ToastMe
It’s a nice cup.,2,ToastMe
Hi that mug is gorgeous! And I would totally buy any mugs/cups you made! You’re gonna do great in your degree of choice!,2,ToastMe
That mug is SOOOO much prettier than everything I’ve ever made in ceramics combined! You’ve got real talent!,2,ToastMe
"Well I love that piece and wish i could buy a set that looks like that. If you keep up that work and your passion, you're gonna do great things",2,ToastMe
"Another person doing something they love over something practical. You have to remember that you're only going to stick with something you love, doing a more traditional degree like ""bioscience"" or something isn't practical if you hate it and never do anything with it. Ceramics is practical because you love it and so it will help you specifically do something you want to do in the future. Also your mug is great, do you have like a store or something where you sell your ceramics?",2,ToastMe
"The thing you love produces something - that means it can be practical as well.  But even if it's not, treasure the time doing something you love and find the lessons in it that you can apply to working life in general.  Dedication, focus, creativity - all of it is has value.  My practically useless (philosophy) has still lead to achieving a dream job.  It can for you too!",2,ToastMe
Good dip on that glaze sista ☕️,2,ToastMe
Wow looking at that mug I most certainly would say its practical for you to do. I'm really happy you found something that you love that will get you by in life. Have fun and keep up the good work!,2,ToastMe
It's only not-practical until you've got a job...,2,ToastMe

"I live in Australia and there are heaps of local ceramicists around doing it full time! A lot of them also do workshops - something to look into for extra cash in the future.

"I’m 44, I wish I had done something that I love. 
You made the right choice!!!",2,ToastMe
"Honestly thats amazing. And let me say this you can always do a variation of that job, like teaching ceramics! My high school ceramics teacher was a wonderful woman and brought to much light to my life. I loved her class so much and would have taken her class over again if I wasnt a senior when I first had her. You can do ceramics at after school programs or underprivileged kids. It was one of my many favorite programs at the boys and girls club! You can open a ceramics shop!! I loved going with my mom when I was little and painting and glazing mugs and vases. Also I’d like you to know that while writing this I noticed that I really like ceramics a lot more than I realized lol so thank you!!!",2,ToastMe
Hey. Choosing something you love to do os the best choice you can make. Do not let anyone else tell ya differently. That mug looks beautiful. How did you even make that? Keep on doing what you love and you will get where you need to be soon enough.,2,ToastMe

My auntie's kitchen cabinets are full of pretty much exclusively artisanal ceramics exactly like that mug in your pic.

There's a massive market for that kind of stuff, you'll make it!",2,ToastMe
"1) Ceramics is a perfectly practical career, you won't be making money hand-over-fist, but it's not Underwater Basket-weaving.  
2) Even if you're in ceramics purely for the art, it's better to live a humble life doing what you love than living a lavish life doing something you hate, though that's just my opinion.  
3) If you decide later that you want to go into something else, many places that aren't doing specialist work will be content to see any degree, even if it's not super relevant.",2,ToastMe
"So,  The way I look at it is ceramics is really cool it may not net you a lot of money but that doesn't mean you can't work on ceramics on the side and work a nother job until a ceramics business provides an opportunity for you or something along those lines.",2,ToastMe
"Choosing something you love is better that doing something practical, you’ll enjoy it more and you would already know what to do. Never judge yourself about thinking what the wrong choices are, think about the ones that you love. Dunno if that sounded right but I’m rolling with it, thats a very lovely mug btw!",2,ToastMe
"Gorgeous mug! What you put into a career like that is what you’ll get out of it. I dropped out of college where I had a hefty academic scholarship to attend beauty school and jeez you’d think my choice ruined other people’s lives. I’m so much happier though. That’s what matters! I have no doubt you’ll find that you’re glad you made the choice to do what you love. Those big stem careers are bLEGH to a lot of people, I mean good on someone who likes it but there’s so much more to life than the money you make and it’s not like you’ll not make anything especially if you’re great! And I have no doubt that you are good at what you do! 
The further you get into it the more you’ll realize it was the best decision! People love to have a word in on everyone else’s lives when really they don’t give a damn, meaning you shouldn’t give a damn what they say! 
Good luck. :)",2,ToastMe

"Heckin' dope! I am 30 and still in grad school because I felt pressure to study science and gathered two degrees in a ""close enough"" field before finally realizing that I was an idiot and going for the life I wanted directly. 

Also, I honestly feel the world is changing and as a result what is ""practical"" is changing too. Don't let other people stress you out because they don't know any better than you do, you're just betting on different horses.",2,ToastMe
"I mean yeah it will be difficult to make money from it, but you have plenty of time to try and you will never forget those skills.",2,ToastMe

And if you make it we will all be insanely jealous!",2,ToastMe
"First I LOVE your hair. Second, that is a beautiful mug. Third, I regret choosing a practical major over something I love for the sake of money. You may struggle at first but you will be able to spend your life doing what you enjoy!!",2,ToastMe
"I personally know someone who later in life abandoned their career, and went full into her ceramics passion. She didn’t make quite as much money, but still did alright with selling pieces and doing lessons, and was SO MUCH happier. She has often told me she wished she had just started with it out of college. She’s still making amazing art, but is somewhat retired and doesn’t have her own kiln anymore. She also, gardens, plays cello in a local band, paints and explores different mediums, makes fermented foods, bicycles, and is just generally amazing. So, you are well on your way to out pacing one of the coolest people I know! And having a degree in anything is always a leg up if you find a new passion and want to go back to school! You are so young and ready to be “fired” up, don’t let doubts get in the way!",2,ToastMe

Besides, being able to throw a bowl with a proportional wall thickness, base to lip, isn't practical. It's a wondrous art.",2,ToastMe
"It’s actually the degree you want, doesn’t matter so much what it’s in. If you love ceramics, you’re clearly not trying to become an astronaut or neurologist, so the degree will most likely serve you well in securing employment until you’re able to find ways to earn a living doing what you love. A degree is a great thing! I was a smartass and decided to just give up on college altogether. I’m still doing what I love and I’ve never been asked for a degree to get a job (I’m a filmmaker) but I often wish I’d just finished. So you’ve done well so far!",2,ToastMe
"You can absolutely make a career out of something you love if you work hard enough! First off, that mug is gorgeous and I want one. If you have an online shop and advertise it on your social media I bet people are going to flock there because your stuff looks like it's going to be lovely. 
Honestly, I did an illustration degree and for about a year after I graduated I thought it was the worst decision, but I pulled my socks up and started really working towards it and now it's my full time job! And honestly, you're a lot more skilled than I was after graduating if that mug is anything to go by. So I think you can feel great about doing something you love! I hope you continue to love it as you continue to develop as a creator - not everyone is able to do something they love so you made a great decision in choosing it!

"Making ceramics is the first practical thing humans made (after fire).  Plus, you are amazing.",2,ToastMe
"The mug is as gorgeous as you yourself (very!)

And you are always right to at least give your dreams a try... ""Find a job you love & you'll never WORK a day in your life"" as they say... Time enough to do something 'practical' if/when ceramics doesn't work out- this way, you won't die wondering ""what if...?""

Fwiw, I wanted to become an actress, and was good enough to prompt recasting of a local theatre production age 14 when I refused to play the 2nd best kids part, I said I  auditioned ""only for the lead kids part"" (nepotism IMO, there simply wasn't a better auditionee and director clearly agreed) As you may have noticed I had the ego to match & the whole diva thing down too ;)

Anyway I took my mothers advice(""actors are unemployed most of the time"" ""get a proper degree"" etc etc ad nauseum) and got a degree in medical radiation instead... Graduating shortly after a skills shortage in the field had been filled, & becoming an unemployed medical radiation technician-bloody hell, I might as well have been an unemployed actress, hey!

- Make a channel on how to do it

- do archaeological studies as well and work in a museum.

Etc.  

But also, I don't know your age but I am of the early millenials, so not young anymore. However, I will do everything in my power to try and make the world at your graduation a place where you needn't dread going after what you love to do than what others would love for you to do.

This, this is awesome. It's not considered practical because the few who do this as well as you figure out of to build a business.

You can always go back and get a secondary in small business to round out your portfolio. When I was a kid I really loved working on things and wanted to fix motorcycles. I had wanted to go to a mechanics school when I graduated. My dad’s advice was to find something else b/c he thought if I did what I loved for a living it would be ruined by the daily grind and I’d eventually hate it. As an adult I can understand why he thought that but it’s not advice I would give my kids. Chase your dreams girl!",2,ToastMe
"One of my dad's favourite possessions before he passed was this collection of mugs. They're all printed with different abstract images of our country's traditional industries. On the bottom alongside the company name is their motto: ""People will always need plates.""

You're in the right industry if you're looking for a job with longevity.

Also I love the mug that you've made. Send me a DM if you ever have any for sale!",2,ToastMe
"I got two degrees in music. Don’t use them in my day to day life hardly at all, but I still love playing music. Have a friend that got a degree in digital art - his day job is an auto claims adjuster but still draws all the time for fun. My husband is a philosophy major who now spends all day playing with formulas and excel programming. My mom got her degree as a medical technologist in the 70s. She lasted maybe 5 years before she realized it wasn’t for her.

You don’t know where you’re going to wind up, there are worse things to do than immersing yourself in a passion.",2,ToastMe
" Your work is beautiful and I have seen a lot of artists prosper in this field.  You would do really well in Corning, NY! Lots of ceramic artists there and people come from everywhere to buy them. I think a lot of people doubt whether they're making the right choice for their future. You found something that makes you happy! Sounds like the right choice to me",2,ToastMe
"I see a lot of great advice here, and I wanted to add my take on your decision. I think you absolutely have done the right thing choosing ceramics! Just know what you are getting into. Everything having to do with clay is super expensive, which can be very stressful when the goal is to be creative and make art, but there are a few ways to make it work, here is mine...

I have a BFA in ceramics, and have been making in a shared studio for about 5 years post grad. Only in the past 2 years have I been making a real push to build my pottery business. I mostly sell at local craft sales and make around $7000CAD  in sales per year (the past 2 years). I have been working full time since graduating (food industry, currently a receptionist at an animal hospital) and this steady source of income has been THE KEY to achieving my art dreams! It means I work basically 2 full time jobs and it’s exhausting, but I have been able to slowly accumulate everything I need (kiln, clay, website, a tent for outdoor sales, everything costs big money!) without the panic of NEEDING to sell everything I make. It takes time to find your style, which is important to set yourself apart (let’s face it, etsy is full to the brim with handmade mugs) and it’s important to be sure of your product and your message, which usually requires a lot of testing and fine tuning. Art can also cause serious burnout, so the slow build over the weekends and evening of quietly working on my goals has been key for me. 

So I guess what I’m saying is, it might be a good idea to do both options. Invest in your education by maybe taking electives so you can get a secure job, but never forget the “real” job is just a placeholder to fund your creative dreams! Good luck to you in whatever you decide! 

A couple helpful things I’ve learned:
- handmade pottery is a big business and lots of people are successful, watch what they do and make a plan
- see yourself as not just an artist but a business! Marketing and networking is about 40% of my time spent, 60% actually making the thing. 
- check out Hand and Fire, she is a full time ceramic maker and very open about how she makes it all work. 
- give yourself room to fail! You probably already know this, but a lot of times ceramic things break. Take some pressure off yourself by having some kind of backup plan or safety net. For me it’s my steady job and not committing to sales until I already have the stock.
- believe in yourself!! There are people out there who want to give you money and support makers of handmade things, present your work with joy and pride and they will find you!",2,ToastMe
"(sorry for my bad english) 
That's a lovely mug :) it's very beautiful and rustic, if you plan to make ceramic for a living, it will sure be hard, since its hard to create a unique style, but if you keep on working on your style, and once you've found your own, then im sure you'll be successful :) you're clealy talented.",2,ToastMe
"My partner does ceramics. It started off as a hobby and has slowly morphed into a side hustle that's bringing in a decent amount of money! You can absolutely turn your love for ceramics into a serious career. Especially with a degree in it. You got this, OP! ♥️",2,ToastMe
"People who shame others for getting degrees in art don't understand the importance art has in history. Even the shittiest piece of art provides insight into an actual individual's mind.

"1) beautiful mug
2) beautiful hair (wow your hair is so cute)
3) beautiful forehead and eyebrows
4) beautiful nose ring
5) beautiful skin

Ceramics is practical. I’m not going to eat straight off the table and I’m not going to drink out of my hands. Not only that but it makes people happy. I would much rather someone do something that makes them happy but isn’t as practical as other jobs than do something that is practical but they hate. You do a job much better when you enjoy it.",2,ToastMe
"First off, I want that mug. 

Secondly, I went to school for both something practical and something I loved. In the end, I hated it. I went to school to be a chef. I haven't cooked for anyone other than my family for years.

Do you have an etsy page? I would buy that mug or a similar one in a heartbeat. Have you looked into vendor events and craft shows? Selling in local gift shops? 

There's a market for it!",2,ToastMe

I never heard that you can do a degree in ceramics before! I think that choice is amazing and makes you a special and interesting person. And what could be more practical than crafting stuff?

At first I thought that, well problem is only a few people are exceptional enough to make a living doing art, and out of those, even less are lucky enough to get the exposure. But then I realized that that sort of thinking is whats holding us back from the the utopia that star trek promises, assuming a post scarcity economy. Where everyone gets to work on exactly what they love because no one actually has to work for a living. Art is such an underrated part of society. Please post more of your pieces. :)",2,ToastMe

"You did the right thing! I can tell you from experience it’s not worth choosing money over something you love.
I got my master in architecture and made enough money in six month to be me a real nice car just for fun. Just because I could.
But I traded it for three years of professional training, living on just a couple hundred quit a month and now I’m a truck driver. 
I make half the money I made before and am away for work from Monday to Friday. I basically live on the roads in my big rig. 
Sometimes it’s uncomfortable, boring, you feel lonely and hate the traffic. But I have never been more happy in my life! Choosing something I truely love has been the best decision I could have ever made!
I’m so proud to tell people about my life, what I quit for truck driving and that I’m now driving across the country just being me and absolutely free!

"Please send me a link to your Etsy page when you set up one! It is absolutely beautiful, I would love to buy a mug from you. I can’t say whether pursuing your passion over someone more practical will work out for you, and nobody really can. The truth is some people make it, and some people don’t, but whatever happens, I don’t think you should ever regret taking a chance on something that you love. You’ve taken your passion and reached a level with it that you may never have reached on your own (maybe), and now you have a skill that you can take with you for the rest of your life. I hope that you accomplish your goals, but just know that even if things don’t work out the way you hope they will, that you can always make extra money with your craft. I know that I will definitely be purchasing a mug from you, my fiancé has a thing for mugs, so I cannot wait to see a page where I can purchase one from you. I wish you all the luck in the world, as well as the energy, and motivation to reach your goals. It seems like you don’t need those last two, though, judging by the looks of that mug.",2,ToastMe

I could tell you that you're cute as a button, but I doubt that matters to you right now (at least, it wouldn't to me). When I'm low, being told that I'm valuable and make meaningful contributions to the world is important to me. And I bet you have no idea how wonderful you make some people's lives.

"First of all, your makeup is sooo good.  What eyeliner do you use?

Secondly, I’m so deeply sorry that you’re going through this right now.  You may not believe me right now, but the very act of calling the hotline and posting here just goes to show how incredibly strong you are.  It takes an intense amount of physical and mental strength to reach out when you’re in such a dark place.  There’s something within you that still wants to keep going.  There’s a little flame inside, and even if it’s small or hard to see right now behind the smoke, it’s there.   It’s telling you to keep living and fighting.  I promise you that even though it’s possibly going to be the hardest thing you’ve ever done, you won’t regret tending to that little flame and finding more things that give you that drive to *keep living.* 

Please feel free to message me if you’d like extra support :) We’re around the same age and I know the battle that you’re facing.  It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever had to face, and I can begin to fathom how much you must be hurting because I’ve hurt too.",2,ToastMe
"You are a beautiful nerd. I, also, am a beautiful nerd. Let's be friends?

Seriously hurts my heart to see you in this head space thinking about suicide. Please know that you're worthy and important. I struggle with depression too. You're definitely not alone, and you're with a large group of awesome people who have depressive thoughts. There's nothing wrong with us, it's something wrong with the world. Please don't give in to it.

You're also absolutely gorgeous, your makeup is awesome and you have a nose people pay thousands of dollars for.

"I am so proud of you for taking the first steps! My sister is in the same boat as you , and what helps her is a regular sleep schedule (easier said than done, I know lol). I have found that exercise boosts my self-confidence when I'm feeling down, maybe it could boost yours too. You are very pretty and the work you are doing is extremely important, I hope you can recognize that for yourself. You may have a tough road ahead of you, but I can tell your a fighter.

"Good shit Abby! Keep it up and remember there is nothing wrong in asking for help when you need it! Pursuing these kinds of change requires acceptance of what got you to the point you are at and that can be very overwhelming at times. You are not alone in traveling this path and there are lots of people who can help you stay the course. Also, relapse is a part of recovery. If you do get to that point, remember that you can always get back on the path. Mistakes do not make you who you are, it is how you chose to move forward after. We are all broken and all need help from others to heal.",2,ToastMe
You've got this!,2,ToastMe
Congratulations! You're one step on your way to an incredible life.,2,ToastMe

"Honey, I just want you to know that no matter what, you'll be okay.
Im an ex sh, and it took me years to get to the point that you're already at. The obsession and withdrawals will die down in the first few weeks, and after that it's concentrating on undoing the emotional conditioning. 
You need to know: everyone has hiccups.
You can be clean for years and have a singular night of relapse; that doesn't start you back at square 1, I promise you. You say to yourself ""okay, I had a bad night. Tomorrow I keep going.""
You're beautiful and you can make it.
Never be ashamed of what you've done; you may not have made it to this point without it.
Sending you love and positive vibes ♡
We're in this together.",2,ToastMe

"Hang in there, please! I know it’s hard to resist. Get some paint or sketch something. 

Actually. Draw a picture of, what you feel, is your addiction monster and then everyday draw the same monster, but weaker or even beat up. More and more everyday. Doesn’t have to be elaborate.
In fact, being less elaborate would help symbolize how little it really means to you.",2,ToastMe
It's been a month now! You're incredible!,2,ToastMe
So is tomorrow the day? :),2,ToastMe
"Hey bb, sorry that there are shitheads talking down to you in your toast (I always scroll all the way to the bottom to see whether there has been any rude response before commenting), it seems like just existing as a young-looking woman draws them in (I’ve been getting it too, my whole damn life). 

I had this same issue when I was younger & I got clean from it around the age that you are now (maybe a year after). There were a couple books that I read that really helped me to understand the chemical reasoning behind it & honestly, understanding why my brain does what it does (& the fact that I don’t have to always listen to it) kind of turned my life around in a lot of ways. 

Will you send me a message if you might want a reading recommendation or two? Or if you just want to talk about stuff- I became a counselor because of how much stigma I saw towards mentally ill women & people of color (as a client in the field) & now I work with a bunch of awesome people who are doing the same thing & we fight it every single day & it’s amazing. Well, right now we don’t work at all haha, but it is my life’s work...

Just keep on keeping your head above the water, I promise you that the waves will subside. You’ve got this!",2,ToastMe

"Congratulations! Being in the navy was my dream for so many years. Enlisted during my senior year in high school. Unfortunately I got separated during boot camp for medical reasons related to my heart and a heart surgery I had as an infant.

"Transitioning to being a civilian is a difficult process, but it’s so nice to be able to be my own person now. I’ve finally started experimenting with my look now that I can and I’m starting to grow into myself. What helped me getting adjusted is that my school has a decent veterans organization that gave me a pretty solid friend group from the jump. I’m in my second semester though and still don’t have any friends not connected to the military, in some way. I guess my advice to you is that you may not feel like you’re always going to have a task and purpose anymore, and that’s okay, because their aren’t many of my vet friends who do. But we have each other, and at least we’re trying to find that purpose together.",2,ToastMe

It's the ""unimaginable talents and values"" bit that I really like. So true.",2,ToastMe
"Trying your best is exactly that, your best. You never need to feel like what you do isn’t good enough, especially when you’re giving it your best. Even on days when it’s not your best, that’s ok. Everybody has off days and everybody has productive days. Your worth doesn’t come from what you do, it comes from you. That’s it. You + nothing = all the worth in the world. Never ever let anyone tell you otherwise :) 

You are a beautiful, unique individual!! The world needs the special talents, abilities, perspectives and experiences only YOU can bring!! That is so so far from worthless, that’s incredible! Hang in there and try to remind yourself your worth is intrinsic and never earned :)",2,ToastMe
"Been there before, and trust me, it'll feel so good when you prove to them that you are capable enough, and you are. You are trying your best, and that's good. School's been pretty hectic for me as I was being overbooked with worksheets, and I've been through weeks of failure, and people kept insulting me, telling me I'm no good, but that didn't stop me from getting ahead. Now I'm caught up, and I'm one of the top students here. There are so many things one person can do, and don't let the assholes in your life tell you you're no good. You are capable. You have the potential to succeed. I hope it all goes well for you. :D",2,ToastMe
You have survived 100% of your worst days so far. You got this. Just keep swimming. Sent with love from a Dad.,2,ToastMe
"Don't let them get to you. And don't berate yourself.

I've been there many times before.  Both from myself, and from others. I have lots of internal conflicts and have an extremely low self esteem, and some people are just like that. And, as cheesy as it sounds:

It gets better. I know it doesn't feel like it, but it does. Trust me, I've been there. When you feel worthless and feel like giving up, just know that if you keep your head up and in the game, it feels so much better later.

You even had the bravery of posting this on this site. You did what I couldn't. I personally haven't felt obligated to do so.

You look way better than I do. Just throwing that out there.

Your facial structure is natural. Your eyebrows are eye-catching, in a very good way. Your hair looks pretty. Your eyes look very pretty. Everything about you, from what i see, is good.

***Keep being yourself.*** Like I said, I've been where you are many times. You will eventually come to terms with who you are, just like many people have already done.

I’ve missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I’ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. -- Michael Jordan

But, seriously. I believe in you. Prove them wrong. :D",2,ToastMe
you look very kind and sweet. whatever you are going through will pass soon enough. say a prayer and go for a better day tomorrow!,2,ToastMe
"All anyone can do is their best. Some days your best kicks butt. Some days your best isn’t as impressive, but that’s OK. 

There’s no scoreboard for your value - you just have value, period. You’re valuable for who you are, for the people who care about you, for your potential to do good, to make the world better, one small act, one day at a time. 

Just keep being you. Keep doing your best. And know that you’re valuable no matter how good your best is on any given day.",2,ToastMe
"I had been told this when I was growing up. You're not alone. It really hurts to hear. The first couple times it kind of just falls on deaf ears but then, after the 15th or 20th time, it starts to stick. That's when you start to hear it in your head while you're working. Or doing homework. Or cleaning. You hear it. Its taken me a long time to fight it. 

I know it is easier said than done but dont listen to it. I took the easy way out to try and ignore it all and I regret it. It actually makes it harder. 

Make yourself a mantra. That's what I do now. Fight their repetitive negativity with repetitive positivity. You're doing great. You made it. This is amazing. Keep going, you're doing it. It doesnt seem like much but the more you repeat, the more you feel it. 

When I was younger, I'd cry to my father telling him I felt worthless and that anything I did wasn't good enough. I felt like I was such a disappointment. He told me ""Look, did you try your best? Then that's all I could ever ask for. I dont want you to do anymore than that. Be proud of yourself because I am.""

I think of that and repeat it to myself everytime I feel low.",2,ToastMe
"All you can do is your best. You are not worthless. You’re hardworking, resilient, and you will use those two amazing traits to get you through this time in your life. You may not feel it, but you are doing so well. I’m proud of you.",2,ToastMe

"Happy Birthday, I have to agree with others and say you look much younger and are gorgeous! I’m going on 4 years single, wandering the world, being 35 with an old soul (or no soul as a day walking ginger), no kids as well so can pass for 20s when shaven.

"Did you get the 2 and the 4 around the wrong way?! You have got amazing skin! I’m sorry you’re feeling down on your birthday. Sometimes birthdays suck cs there’s so much pressure to be happy and throw a party and have fun, which can make you feel worse if you’re already feeling a bit lonely. I hope that your birthday improves and someone puts a smile on your face today :)
About being single when your 42 - in my view it’s better to be single than be with the wrong person. Take the time now to be selfish. Do things for you and you alone. My mum met the love of her life after years of marriage, 4 kids, and a divorce that made us very poor. And even though it took her a bit longer to find true love she’s the happiest she’s ever been. You’ll find the right person too :) in the meantime be selfish! And happy birthday from a reddit stranger! Xx",2,ToastMe

"Happy birthday! 39/M here and Tbh, would not approach you because you look so young. I'd feel like a creep. Do you happen to have social anxiety? This affected my dating life BIG TIME. I used to feel that I wasn't interesting and that nobody wanted to actually be my friend, let alone date me. I decided to put my son first as a single dad for 6 years. Things finally fell into place for me.   Just curious because you are quite attractive.",2,ToastMe

"Happy birthday!! 

Your skin is flawless. Absolutely freakin' gorgeous. Everyone is saying how you're aging gracefully (to be honest, I'd argue about whether you're even ageing to begin with) but I'd like to just say that from your replies to comments here alone, you seem like a truly lovely, witty, funny and warm person. Anyone would be lucky to be your partner, but please don't forget that you are so so so so much more than your love life. You're just as valuable, deserving and amazing with or without a partner. I hope you find someone equally as lovely as you, of course, but your love life doesn't define you. 

Have a great great birthday and celebrate yourself. You looks absolutely fantastic, you're a wonderful person and you can do anything you set your mind to. 

Keep on kicking ass :)",2,ToastMe

"Happy birthday OP! I turned 30 last month, and I’ve been single for 5 years. I go back and forth on if I want to start dating again, but it’s been so long I realistically have no idea how to start. Hope you have better luck!",2,ToastMe

I legitimately thought in that brief moment before going back that I'd just seen my 22 year old cousin posted on Reddit. Whatever you're doing, it's working. I hope you find what you're looking for :)",2,ToastMe
"Guys, she just says 42 so people dont think she's underage on tinder",2,ToastMe

"As a fellow ""eight years single"" club member, I have to say you look 22, not 42.   I wouldn't think that you'd have any trouble finding dates.  I have to assume it's previous emotional pain that keeps you single, because it's clearly not your looks.",2,ToastMe

I know that you are capable of finding more happiness, and I hope it happens quickly. But don't despair if it does not - you are working on the most important part of life (not weight... happiness!) and it can be a gradual process. But as long as you do not stop trying, I promise you will find it. You look kind and I would like to be your friend. Congratulations on your 35 pounds - and good luck in the future.",2,ToastMe

"hey man, i’m sorry you’re going through a rough patch. change in general is hard and the change you went through physically is a huge one for that matter.

Your smile in both pics eminate joy! Keep that happiness going!,2,ToastMe
"Keep up the good work! You deserve to be happy and confident, no matter what weight you are. I know how much weight can affect your mental health, but just remind yourself you are starting your journey and that is what is important! I suggest using a habit tracker, I have one on my home screen (android) for working out and it keeps me on track. Good luck on your journey.

"Dude you are not ugly in either picture. You have a warm smile, welcoming eyes, and you're working on becoming a better you. That's beauty right there my man. Keep at it and somebody is bound to notice.

A couple self improvement tips:

-Dont fall for the ""fuck it day"" lie we tell ourselves. Making progress isn't about one day of tremendous effort, it's about a baseline of consistent effort. It's better to make good choices, but not making bad choices will do for the days where you just can't go the extra mile.

-the weight is just a number, you're health is what matters. If you have good numbers from you're doctor, it doesn't matter if you never quite lose the love handles. You are still an attractive person either way.

-losing weight is healthier over a longer period so be patient

-if your main goal is to lose the weight limiting calories is the number one method. Exercise will mainly help build muscle, not burn fat, if you aren't working on a caloric deficit. Not saying starve yourself before you workout, just that eating a bit less than you normally would is better than doing 1000 situps for weight loss.

Most of all don't hate yourself. Respect yourself. Want better for yourself. Believe that you deserve the life you want, because you do. Believe you can achieve your goals, because you can.

Don't hate yourself because you let yourself down. We all do in one way or another at some point in our lives. Just be glad you decided to make a change when you were young.

I'm 26 now, and when I was as 22 I almost made the change. I gave up a bunch of times. I still fall down, but since I gave up on hate I stopped staying down as long.




P.s. if any of this is old news or not helpful to you I apologize. I don't want to act like I know the secrets to life or anything because I definitely don't. It just breaks my heart seeing people loathe themselves before loving themselves. And sorry it's so long.",2,ToastMe

"Know it's only the depression telling you these ugly things about yourself, because you're a handsome young man with a smile filled with light. 
Having the motivation to start exercising while depressed is exceedingly difficult I think, so massive congratulations. 
Keep making small steps in the direction you want to go, you've got this. 
I've struggled with my weight and eating disorders for years. I've loved myself and my body when I was bigger, and hated it when I was very slim and wanted it to be even smaller. So my advice would be that love for yourself comes from within and how you treat yourself. Your self worth isnt linked to what's on the outside.",2,ToastMe
"Bro you look freaking amazing my dude, keep it up and congrats on your journey!!! You got this! 💪💪💪",2,ToastMe

"HEY! 😠 I'm gonna mom you for a hot minute so pay attention.

You.👏 Do.👏 Not. 👏 Talk about yourself that way.  ""Ugly fat black guy""... You stop it. Right now. 

It's ok to say that you are dissatisfied with your appearance, but you DO NOT call yourself ugly or fat, you hear me? If you do that, you are handing every single person a permission slip to do the same and that is unacceptable. And if people call you that, they are not your people. I don't even know you yet and neither of those worn-out, lame-ass adjectives come to mind when I look at you.  You have a beautiful smile, and awesome hair. And from the little you've shared, you're young and still figuring life out. So you've hit a rough patch. THAT'S OK. But you do not belittle yourself for being human.  You own it and move on.  Show people what's on the inside of you because that's what matters.  You said it yourself: you're on a journey. You're not there yet so why you beatin' yourself up?  Be kind to yourself, son.  ❤️

Now go clean your room. 🥰😘",2,ToastMe
"Sir, you're effing beautiful. Stop calling yourself ugly.",2,ToastMe

"Someone I know talks about his relationship with progress like this:

*I've made mistakes. But I'm kind to the past version of myself because I want my future self to do the same for the current me.*

You're not disgusting, you're on a journey.  I'm so proud/excited to read what you've done, and know what comes next will make you just as proud of yourself. Stick with it.",2,ToastMe

P.S.: You are not one bit ugly my dude!",2,ToastMe
"Hey dude, you’re awesome for so many reasons.

First, you’re awesome for taking the steps to better yourself.  Working to get in shape is a tough process, no one’s good at it when they first get started!  I’m proud of you for going through with it even though it’s difficult.  That’s admirable in and of itself.

Second, you’re awesome because you have the courage to share about it.  That takes some guts my man, and I think you’re great for doing so.

Third, you have a spectacular smile.  It has to be said.

Overall, I’m proud of you dude.  It’s a tough journey for sure, but you’ll get there!",2,ToastMe

"Hey man, hope you’re doing well! You look like a very genuine and fun guy! I’ve been a long time lurker on this sub but your post was what caught my eye. That smile is just absolutely contagious! I’m sorry to hear you’ve been through some rough depressive times, I know the feeling all too well.

Coming out of high school I was fit and excited to see where life took me. I experienced a very traumatic event my first year of college and have been suffering with depression and PTSD ever since. I gained a lot of weight over the next year and it was only making my depression worse.

I’m so happy to hear that you’re actively working out and being proactive about the things that upset you. The first step in getting mental support is figuring out for yourself what upsets and challenges you. It took me what feels like too long to get to that point, but—while not perfect—I have been a lot happier and have dealt with a lot less anxiety, depression and self-consciousness.

I hope you keep the grind up, your progress is incredible! Nothing but love and good vibes ✌🏼",2,ToastMe

I was overweight and spent a year losing over 70 pounds on keto.  That was four years ago and I've kept it off.  Ok, ok, quarantine added a few pounds, but like you I'm working at it and that's the best we can do.  The great thing about working out and losing the excess is it massively helps with depression too!  Keep it up and keep that amazing smile on your face.",2,ToastMe

"Bro, at no point are you ugly or disgusting. Weight management is a lifelong journey - and life has its ups and downs.

I hit my lowest adult weight last year - 189lbs. Still almost 40lbs overweight. It had been 2 years of counting calories, struggling with disordered eating, depression, and physical disability. It was hell. And then I broke. My depression took a downward turn, and within *a month*, I gained back what it had taken me years to lose. Some bullshit, right? I'm not over it. And now I'm at my heaviest.

But. The silver lining is that I have a better idea of what works. The things I thought were sustainable - most of them weren't. And managing my mental state is key.

Step one to managing mental state: stop insulting yourself. You wouldn't take care of someone you hated for very long. But ""just stop hating yourself"" isn't good advice, it's vague, unactionable, and seems impossible. So instead: stop voicing and reinforcing that hatred. Don't say it aloud, don't write it down. When you think it - counteract it with something nice, or at least neutral. When you want to think ""I'm ugly,"" and you can't bear to change it to ""I look good,"" at least try ""There is more to me than my body.""

If you can catch yourself, even better. Yesterday I said ""Aw damnit, I should have eaten before I left the house, I'm such an - such a person who forgot to eat."" Is it as good as not harping on myself? No. But it's leaps and bounds better than putting that negativity out there and reinforcing my negative self image.

Anyway this is getting long and rambling, so I'll leave you with this: You may be fat (although real talk - I think you look pretty normal? But I have a policy of letting people call themselves fat even if they're thinner than me), but you're far from ugly. And even if you *were* ugly, you don't owe it to anyone to look a certain way. You're a wonderful and worthy person at any weight, with any face or any voice or any height. You have talents and abilities, interests, hobbies, passions and friendships to offer. There is *so* much more to you. And for that reason, you can never be ugly or disgusting in the truest sense. You're great. You got this. Keep up the good work. 💗",2,ToastMe
You are NOT disgusting. You are amazing and I’m proud of your development and self betterment.,2,ToastMe
You have a stunning smile,2,ToastMe
"Hi, I think you are very cute and you seem to be super cool. I'm sure that you will achieve your goals and keep in mind that we as humans can have lots of emotions in just one day. Try to focus on the good vibes and whenever you feel like that dark cloud is hovering on top of you, try to get distracted: clean your room, go out for a walk, try to doodle or do something that makes you feel better.

"Late to this, but man, you aren’t ugly in either of these photos. It’s good to want to improve on yourself, but you’re a valid, beautiful person in both of these photos.",2,ToastMe
"Don't beat yourself up my dude, going into a place of punishment and self hate is not only harmful and really illogical for a lovely gorgeous person like yourself - its inefficient!! 

Every single day, say no to those demons who tell you to hate yourself and change - diet and weight loss culture has perpetuated this culture of using hate as a mechanism to change our bodies, when really it's an energy that burns out quick and painfully. I've found that giving myself a break and saying yeah you know what I didn't do what I wanted - but I'm gonna do something about it now - the most helpful approach",2,ToastMe
"My dude, your smile is catching! Gave me absolute pure joy - Thank you! 

Sorry to hear you are struggling with depression,  I don't think there is much I can say to help with that,  but what I would say is when you are having a down moment just think back yo all these toasts on here! 

I hope all is better for you soon and whatever you do, make sure you keep smiling!",2,ToastMe

"I don't struggle with my weight, but I do know what it's like to lack self confidence. It's hard to regain it and it's definitely a very different battle, seeing as keeping up with exercising is hard at first! But still, things we have to work towards in order to find ways to have peace with the people that we are and want to become. Be proud about the journey you are taking and acknowledge even the small things. Sometimes we expect way more than we should of ourselves in a short amount of time, but we just need to focus on the road ahead.
And young man, you are most certainly not ugly ;) ! You've got a great welcoming smile, beautiful skin, rad hair and glasses that complement you! Good luck on this journey of yours. You've got this!",2,ToastMe
"Good news my man, you don't have to *try* to be in control, you ***are*** in control. You got this, you can do it. Keep your head up! Don't let anybody tell you you can't, even if that person is yourself.",2,ToastMe

Positive vibes only! 🤩",2,ToastMe
"You look Amazing and great in both pics but congrats on the weight loss! 

You have one of the nicest, warmest smiles I've seen in my life, and I mean that. It actually made me smile and feel warm and happy inside. Plus you seem like such a kind, generous person and reading your comments confirmed that. I hope you always feel happy, confident and loved. That you can look back on this post, if you're ever feeling low and know that you're so lovable, that you won this subs heart.

 P.S. I'm jealous of your teeth they're perfect my dude.",2,ToastMe
Nah you're really handsome. The Afro and glasses suit you really well. You also have a beautiful smile. Keep pushing and stay positive.,2,ToastMe

"I swear to fucking god I’m not saying this just to flatter you but because I also used to be overweight. You. Are. Hot. You have a really symmetrical face and a nice, approachable look. I am highly confident you would slay with the ladies if you lost the weight. (Not that you’ll be alone without losing it but it will make it easy to get a girl for you.)",2,ToastMe
"You have a beautiful smile! And you wear both of those very different hair styles extremely well. Being fat does not make you or anyone else disgusting, but I do hope working out helps you feel better and love your body. ❤ good luck",2,ToastMe
"I think you look very cute, and I think you should be a little nicer to yourself. Depression lies. It tells you all kinds of stupid crap about yourself.

The unfortunate result of this is that you don't want to make your life better because your depression tells you you never can. Well, that stuff is garbage. All lies.

My depression likes to tell me that nobody actually likes me. They're just being polite. But that's clearly nonsense. But when your brain is in a bad place, when you've been beaten down emotionally, you start to believe that stuff.

Help yourself heal by doubting the nonsense and ask why your brain is going there. Are you stressed about something that's about to happen? Are you just having a really shitty, frustrating week? Do you have some toxic people in your life you need to confront or walk away from?  A lot of things become clearer when you're willing to ask why. Maybe not easier, but clearer.

You're cute, you have a fabulous smile, and it seems like you're really dedicated to making your life better. Those are some great places to start.  :)",2,ToastMe

"Congrats on getting this far!! Once I had passed the 30 day mark, one of the things that helped me stay strong was thinking that in order for me to fail, I'd have to *decide* to start smoking again. If I had even a single cigarette, I'd be deciding to start smoking. And I didn't want to do that, that would be crazy. So I didn't. I stayed the course.     
    
It's been like, 10 years now. It gets easier.",2,ToastMe
"Damn go girl! You’re way too beautiful. You look like you never smoked a cigarette a day in your life! Keep going, the only thing you need is yourself. I quit before I had my daughter and all I can say it feels way better to breathe and actually have a good sense of smell!",2,ToastMe
"great job! you can do it.  When I get a craving I try to think about something else, and before I know it, the craving is gone!",2,ToastMe
"You're a Rockstar for even beginning to quit. I'm on 4 years, and you are definitely inspiring to me! Look up all the things that  change when you quit, and decide that you would rather not meet Cancer. You're going to kill this quitting thing!",2,ToastMe
Heavy smoker too who is in the process of quitting. We got this! Just one day at a time. Every time you fight a craving it's another step to being smoke free. And just think about all the money we are saving. Save it and go on a trip or buy something nice for yourself!,2,ToastMe
"Please, please fight it for the sake of all of us who can't, or aren't for whatever reason. Your own health is paramount, but letting others know that you've quit shines such a bright light. You'll be able to provide some level of hope to a friend, coworker, or family member struggling with the same challenges. Besides, after 30 days cigarettes taste gross compared to what you remember.",2,ToastMe
I'm glad you're taking steps to actively get healthier! It's always nice to see people quit smoking.❤,2,ToastMe

"I lost my wife to cancer. She was a 2 and a 1/2 pack a day girl. You got through the hard part, hang in there for you but when you feel weak think of the people who love you. There is nothing worse than losing a spouse in your 40's from smoking, trust me.",2,ToastMe
"Whenever I felt the need of smoking a cigarette, I had a glass of water or had some pure liquorice (pay attention with potassium balance with the latter). I discovered that the craving lasts nothing more than 5 minutes. Good job by the way. The worst moment is already gone!",2,ToastMe
"When I quit smoking after every milestone I had mentally set for myself I thought “okay I’ve gone a month, I don’t want to have to repeat that again” and before I knew it I was at a year and once you hit a year it’s like you’ve come this far so you have to keep it going! 

I’m 6 years smoke free and the thought of a cig sickens me now. So keep it up, you got this!",2,ToastMe
"You can do it girl. My wife quit smoking when she got pregnant, only smokes one occasionally when she's drunk, maybe once a year. Future you will thank the current you.",2,ToastMe
"Hey, you're a hero. There's so much hard work that goes in to that, well done for reaching out for encouragement to keep going. You don't need the smell, the cost, or the health effects. 30 days is long enough for a new habit to be formed, you've done the hardest work, you are a non-smoker! Lots of respect",2,ToastMe

This is seriously badass! Making a life changing decision in the blink of an eye for the benefit of your baby... You're going to be an awesome Mum. Seriously, you're inspirational.",2,ToastMe
"Congrats to you. Those first 7 days are really fucking hard. Most people will never experience that kind of pain in their whole lives. Remember how brutal it was, not wanting to go through that again is honestly what keeps me sober.",2,ToastMe
Wow! You are such an inspiration! I don't think you can even imagine how brilliant you are 🥰🥰,2,ToastMe
"Sometimes, the life that grows inside of us, saves us.",2,ToastMe
"You are AMAZING. I'm so proud of you, keep doing the work, get a support system and live your (and your bubs) best life ok!!!",2,ToastMe
You got this!!!! Gzgzgz thats so amazing,2,ToastMe
Congratulations!  We are all so proud of you.  You are a super hero.  We are all in your corner supporting you.  Be proud of yourself!!!,2,ToastMe

"LETS GOOOO okkkk. I know it could be hard being sober, but celebrate. You earned it.",2,ToastMe
Congratulations! You took such a huge first step for you and your bub. You’re lucky to have each other!,2,ToastMe
Coming from a family of addicts it's so insanely rare and hard to make the choice you made... It may not feel this way but you are very strong! I'm happy for you,2,ToastMe
My god your beautiful! Oh and great job on staying clean 💪🏽,2,ToastMe
"The first step is always the hardest. You should be very proud of yourself. Its not an easy thing to admit that you even need help, let alone starting that process.

All the best to you and your baby. :) 

Stay healthy and happy out there ✌",2,ToastMe
"Congratulations!!! Just shows how much you love your baby-to-be, that you’ll go through something so difficult to make sure that they’re healthy and happy. Congratulations you strong mama bear",2,ToastMe
"Congratulations for being sober AND on the pregnancy, that is some good news to celebrate as well. 

Remember that a slip isn't the end of the road, you pick up your bike and you ride back on straight awah ! You totally got this. I have no doubt that you will make it because you chose to do this for your child's sake and that's being a good mother already.",2,ToastMe
Congrats sis hope you’re still doing well,2,ToastMe
"bruh, same. It’s nice to see a post that someone else feels that way too, since it’s not something fun that you can post like buying houses, marrying, etc. I’m a proud peacock that you’re sticking to what you want to do, and that you’re halfway to your goal!! 
Just keep swimming, & remember that there’s schools of fish like you swimming long and hard to their destination.
you are improving you, & that’s the best thing to do. 
treat yo’self today!",2,ToastMe
You’re very handsome,2,ToastMe
"You decided to take a harder path that requires more patience, discipline, and dedication. That’s honestly badass! Think of how far you’ve come so far and how much you achieved. I’d personally consider that not stagnant at all. The complete opposite! If you feel you need to switch things up a bit, try to find some time to try new interesting things. In addition, you’re a good looking dude that obviously has some great traits. You’ll easily find someone when the time is right.",2,ToastMe
"Once upon a time, two guys named Neil were at a party with great artists, scientists, athletes, statesmen, etc. The fist Neil turns to the second and says ""I don't think I belong here. All these people have done great things, made great things. I just went where they told me.""  
  The second Neil was taken aback and said, ""But they sent you to the moon.""  
  It's ok to feel inadequate and unqualified for what life hands you. That's normal and natural. But it's not healthy to let those doubts define you. Your accomplishments are often much grander and impressive that you let yourself admit.",2,ToastMe
"You have done so much at this point already, you should be proud! You got a really wonderful smile and nice guy eyes,  just keep smiling and pushing forward! :)",2,ToastMe
Everyone has a different time line.,2,ToastMe
you're doing amazing sweetie!!,2,ToastMe
"You’re working hard, doing well and are blessed with a kind smile and a nice face! Look after your mental health and be well :)",2,ToastMe
"Nice! Trust me, the next couple of years into your PhD will fly by! Keep you head in those books, do as much practical work as possible and keep smiling that beautiful smile! You will smash it! Keep up the good work! :D",2,ToastMe
"First off, you are so cute. Don’t undercut your accomplishments. Trust me, some of those people wish they were in your spot and think they are stagnating. I know (I KNOW!!) it’s hard to not compare. You’re still so young. You’ll have time to do all that stuff, AND you’ll have a PhD. You’re doing great!",2,ToastMe
"Tbh, you look like a really wholesome Chad.

And you are getting a PhD wich is awesome",2,ToastMe
"High five, fellow nerd! I finished my doctoral degree a few years ago and I remember all the feelings you’re feeling. It gets better. You’ll get thru this.",2,ToastMe
"I mean you look like the kind of guy I would want to get married to, have kids, and buy a house with.",2,ToastMe
You a handsome boi no homo,2,ToastMe
"You look so cute and kind! You are halfway there, I believe in you 🌸",2,ToastMe
You don’t have an expiration date for your goals and dreams. You’re doing just fine. Stay strong. Have confidence in what you’ve already accomplished. You’re doing great. Keep reaching!,2,ToastMe
"I feel you bro. Recently finished a 4 year PhD myself. It'll probably start feeling worse (especially when writing up before your submission deadline!) before it gets better but when you get to the end you'll be glad you stuck with it. I also felt like I was lagging behind friends with mortgages, etc, but you've just got to realise you're at a different stage, it'll all come good in the end, and it'll feel all the sweeter when it does. Plus there's nothing more satisfying and righteously smug than changing your title to Dr!",2,ToastMe
I have kids and a partner and often wish I had my time in education again dude! You'll get through the PhD and have your time doing other things. Keep going and look after yourself!,2,ToastMe
"You’re absolutely adorable so don’t worry about getting to that point in your life just yet. You should be proud about pursuing an advanced degree for yourself. I have no doubt that it’s been a very long process for yourself, but you’re strong and you can keep going! I’m rooting for you! Good luck this semester, and the rest after this!",2,ToastMe
Dude you’re doing it! I don’t even know you and I’m proud of you for real! A PhD is a huge deal. You are halfway there. Being tired is part of the grind and means you’re doing what you’re supposed to do right now. When you get to the end of this the cathartic sigh of relief is going to feel sooo good.,2,ToastMe
"4 years into my PhD. My last advisor left me stranded without funding to join a different uni, but my current advisor saved me. Working on a project I like, but essentially had to give up on a dream I had been working on since undergrad. 25 going on 26. And being an international doesn't help either. So yeah, was there, am still there. Maybe it gets better.",2,ToastMe
"I remember feeling so restless while I was getting my Bachelor’s. Now I’m excited to go back and pursue my Master’s degree! Every day at university is a day you are growing. For sure it’s a different experience from your friends’ growth, but it doesn’t mean yours is any less amazing or special (I’d argue it’s actually more of an accomplishment but you get the gist).",2,ToastMe
"School is harder so that working is easier later on. It's all about knowing how to figure it out, not always about knowing everything.

 I'm only a journeyman electrician, but this is one of the biggest things i learned. It's about knowing enough to adapt to your situation, so that everyone goes home safely at the end of the day. I think this would apply to most everyone, even a doctor. Although the doctor has much higher stakes, sometimes. 

Your brain is just burning because your learning.",2,ToastMe
Dont forget that when you're done you will be addressed as Dr... Dr Dr Dr,2,ToastMe
"You’re doing amazing, sweetie",2,ToastMe
"Everyone does different things! You will do those things when you do. Comparison is a thief of joy! Is that the quote? Your friends with kids and houses may be saying ""he's getting a PhD!! I have to wake up at 5am and wipe a butt! Why cant i be him?""   So just enjoy where you are and know that we are all proud of you.",2,ToastMe
"You're so handsome, and you will be a fucking doctor! Be proud!",2,ToastMe
"Dude, wow! I‘m so proud of you for all your hard work and achievements! You’re walking your path, it’s never stagnant. We all have different milestones in our lives and all of them are uniquely beautiful. You got this! 

Oh, and btw: with that smile you could positively swoon anyone!",2,ToastMe
"you are doing so well and I'm so proud of you for sticking out two years so far! you look awesome, you have a great smile, and you've got so many wonderful things ahead of you. as a fellow PhD student I know the struggle, but we can make it! you're doing sooo much better than you think :)",2,ToastMe
"Your replies to people on this thread just show what a thoughtful, kind person you are. Cheers to your hard work and humanity.",2,ToastMe
"Honestly,

I wish I was as good looking, intelligent, and hard working as you are.

Cheers dude, all the best - but honestly you look like you should be on a motivational poster for ""success""",2,ToastMe
Comparison is the thief of joy!,2,ToastMe
Everyone’s already said the best toasts so I’ll just add if your single hit me up,2,ToastMe
A man who is smart AND handsome?? You are so blessed dude. I admire people who are pursuing phd's just as much as people who are starting families. We all bring something to the table and I you assure there are others that hear what you are doing with your life and go wow!,2,ToastMe
I just treat life like Jason Voorhees from Friday The 13th everyone may be going faster than you but if you stay at your own pace and keep at it you’ll kill everyone in the end,2,ToastMe
Smart and handsome huh!,2,ToastMe
Wanna get married,2,ToastMe
You’re a good looking guy. You also look healthy! Keep trucking! It will pay off in the end!,2,ToastMe
"You will get to the same spot, just taking different routes. I had my first kid at 28, first house at 30, 2nd kid at 38, second house at 40 and having my 3rd and last kid at 41. All my friends had their career first and are now doing the marriage and kid thing. Same goals, different routes. Life has a funny way of working itself out.",2,ToastMe
"Let me tell you something, you’re a smart, good looking young man far from stagnation! 
I’m actually in awe of you and just find it amazing that you’re already half way through your PhD - so proud! Keep doing what you’re doing - you’re doing great ❤️",2,ToastMe
"You look like a good dude to chill with. 

Everyone progresses differently. If anything those friends with kids are going to cherish the child free time they’ll get to spend with you while you chug through the next few years.",2,ToastMe
"You are super good looking, plus working on your PhD is a HUGE accomplishment.",2,ToastMe
"I know you already got a ton of comments but just wanted to say that I’m one of those people with a house, husband, and kids and though I’m happy, I so badly wish I would have gotten a degree first and admire people like you so much. You make our world go round. You can do this.",2,ToastMe
You are gorgeous and you are pursuing your dreams. Ignore what others do and look ahead. Something beautiful will come.,2,ToastMe
"PhDs are blooming hard work! I guarantee you that most people go through that period of feeling inept and overwhelmed. Just keep going, you got accepted to do this and you are smart and capable. This is a huge milestone, but you are capable. Believe me it's amazing when it's done!",2,ToastMe
"As a 27 yo about to start a PhD, I'm not sure how to feel about this haha",2,ToastMe
"There’s not an expiration date on doing what you want to accomplish.

Everybody is on their own unique timeline, so don’t compare your current situation to people who are on their own timeline.

It’s Apples and Oranges my dude. Time is anything but stagnant.",2,ToastMe
You will get through this wall just keep pushing. You are super cute and obviously intelligent you can do whatever you set your mind to. And your day will come to find your love.,2,ToastMe
"We all go at life at different paces, so you’re not losing a race by not being married/having kids/buying a house yet. In fact, working towards a PhD? That’s incredible! You’re probably gonna stumble upon this post in the future and smile because all of your efforts paid off :D 

You’re doing the best you possibly can and you’ve accomplished so much already. I can’t imagine how tough its been but you’ve gotten so far- don’t lose hope!! You still have a lot of time.",2,ToastMe
In the words of a wise man “Don’t be scared homie!!!!”,2,ToastMe
"Everyone here is right, you’re just on a different path. Toast to you for being probably the most attractive guy I’ve seen getting their Ph.D! Good luck! 😉",2,ToastMe
"I just wanted to say that you are far from alone in feeling this way in the midst of a PhD program! Speaking as someone in their third year of one, I've come to realize that the feeling of stagnation you mention is pretty much universally experienced by all PhD students - but it's an illusion. I recently had a friend drop out of her PhD program after getting married and having a baby, and guess what? I feel like she's the one who's got her life more together! My point is, it's easy to compare ourselves to our friends whose lives seems to be quickly changing for the better while ours seem to remain the same. But when we graduate in the not so distant future with those degrees which will open so many doors for us, we'll be so happy we stuck it through :).

Stay strong and positive, my friend. Because what you're doing with your life, though different from your friends, is nothing short of amazing :).",2,ToastMe
I compare myself to others too often too......... it’s hard but try to remember this is your story not theirs. You have a great smile 😃 keep it up!!,2,ToastMe
"You know what’s funny? As a married person I kinda envy those who have their PhDs. I think the grass always seems greener in the other side, but I think sometimes we need to remember the grass is greenest where we water it :) everyone has their own path and there’s no “right” way. Be proud of your accomplishments, they’re yours!",2,ToastMe
You're doing great! I am 29 and just now applying to doctoral programs. Your friends are doing great things and so are you! They're just different great things.  :),2,ToastMe
You have the most amazing smile !! And keep pushing - holding your doctorate will be worth all the hard work you’re putting in - you’ll look back on these days and realise how far you’ve come !!,2,ToastMe
are you kidding me?  You are a few years away from #adultgoals. You are about to become every persons dream. Everyone will wish they had what you have. All those things will come your way too.,2,ToastMe
"Keep grinding my friend. Everyone does life at their own pace. I didn't get married until 41. I finished my bachelor's at 28. You do you, there are no milestones but your own. Happiness, and contentment, is a gift you give yourself. Be well, and happy my man.",2,ToastMe
"Never posted in this sub before but your picture made me smile. There is something so positive about your face, it just picked me up. Perhaps if you smile like that at yourself in a mirror it will work on you too!",2,ToastMe
"I get it! School makes you sometimes feel stuck where you are. Just keep pushing forward because you are doing something to further your passion and your knowledge in general. I constantly have to remind myself everything is okay! School is still a part of your journey, just like others with kids and marriage or whatever. You’re doing great! (also the fact that you’re already two years in and still hanging in there proves you are not inept!)",2,ToastMe
"If you are 2 years into aPHD, then you have done much more than many most of the rest of the population. It is fine to feel proud of your friends for reaching certain milestones, but don’t discount your own achievements. You are still able to get married, have kids and buy a house just you are not on the same timeline as these friends. Each person has their own road to travel. As an older adult, I can guarantee you that some of these friends will always wish they had continued on to get just a masters degree let alone a PhD. Others will go back and get the advanced degree when they are much older. Do what is right for you.",2,ToastMe
"I feel you, I’ve been there, I’m still there tbh!

I think it’s amazing how you are toasting your friends AND everyone responding to this thread. It really shows a lot of character and a kind heart. 

I think it’s amazing that you’re dedicating your brain to science and the pursuit of helping others. 

I’m usually a lurker but this post jumped out to me as I was scrolling through, it resonated with me and hit me in the feels.

I’m a resident right now and it too feels like there’s endless schooling left. Seeing my HS/college friends buy houses and start families, I have also felt like my life is stagnant since I’m still living that “student” life. Sometimes it takes a bit for me to see the forest from the trees - and the big picture really is: I love what I do and, despite it being a hard road, I would do it over again. 

P.S. I’m also working on neuroscience research! Who knows maybe we’ll cross paths at a conference in a few years and both be in better headspaces :)",2,ToastMe
"Came here to encourage you but got distracted by your looks. 


hot damn.",2,ToastMe
"Getting my PhD was the worst experience of my life. It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done. Remember, after you finish, you mostly do work with others, and the stakes will always be smaller. It’s hard to see now, but the closer you get the more you’ll be able to see it. It gets only easier.",2,ToastMe
"Hey man, you  are a good looking guy. Your smile and amazing and you are on your way to making great accomplishments in your field! So many people either don’t want to or can’t get into PhD programs but you have worked long and hard enough to accomplish this and you deserve it.",2,ToastMe
"Getting a PhD is HARD, getting a PhD while juggling marriage, kids, and all that would be hard plus some. Two years in at 29, you GOT THIS! you are going to look back in awe of what you have accomplished. Coming from a married mom of 2 who finished her masters at the age of 34, I am in awe of what you are working towards!",2,ToastMe
"Bro don't even start to believe you've plateaued. Keep going strong. Family, love and kids happen organically, don't rush it. Just make sure you're the best you you can be. Finish school strong like you know you can and help others when possible. You got this man.",2,ToastMe
"You’re smart—otherwise you wouldn’t be this close to a Ph.D. 

You’re a hard worker—otherwise you wouldn’t be so tired and overwhelmed.

You’re a good friend—just look at how you’re talking. You’re proud of them! That shows caring and maturity. Some people would just be jealous.

Finally, you have a handsome smile! Lucky! 

Keep on keeping on!",2,ToastMe
"Dude, you're gonna be 31 and have a PhD plus you already have a master degree. Imagine the things you'll be able to do once you get it. It's a big accomplishment. Also I'm sure you're a hit with the ladies. (I'm a guy but you just seem like you'd be popular with girls)",2,ToastMe
In two years you’ll wonder where the time went.  Hang in there!,2,ToastMe
"Come on brother. You are halfway DONE. If you can accomplish getting your PhD you can accomplish ANYTHING. Monetarily speaking, even if you only earn $5,000 more per year with your degree than without, working 40 years at an additional $5K per year equals $200,000. Invested wisely you will be SERIOUSLY banking when you retire. Think smart not self-defeating.",2,ToastMe
"This is a really common thing to feel man, even those people who you imagine are feeling fulfilled are worried if they’re inadequate. It’s about finding your meaning where you can. You’re on your way to a PhD, making your way to a real job with real money. You’ll find the rest of your life in time man.",2,ToastMe
"Keep it going my dude! We all have our own paths, don't compare your path to others. Congrats on the accomplishments and all the rest to come!!",2,ToastMe
You’re such a catch you should be the next bachelor! Girls will line up wanting a chance to love you!,2,ToastMe

I'm married with 2 kids and just bought a house. I'd rather have a good education. Move at your speed and the rest will follow.,2,ToastMe
"Kinda sucks to say it, but you have to learn to appreciate yourself in this situation. Not everyone believes they are worth investing in, but you seem to. If you think you will do great things, you will.

It's taken me 29 years on this Earth (same age as you) to realize amongst my peers, I value myself the least out of everyone I know. Looking to change that this year.",2,ToastMe
"Congratulations on your tenacity & resilience. I see it in you just from looking at your picture. Even through the difficult times your smile is contagious, bright and sincere!

This reminds me of something my mother told me growing up... do you know how to eat a whole elephant? Bite by bite. Remember that everything you are doing has a purpose & while looking at the path ahead would intimidate anyone, focusing on the daily efforts you are making towards your goals allows you to celebrate those victories that feel small but are essential to your next move! 

You might not see it yet but you are high-key kicking ass!",2,ToastMe
Your smile is absolutely gorgeous!! You are so not stagnant! Just working on your own goals in life and you're half way there already!,2,ToastMe

"Holy shit, j cant imagine the dedication and work it would take to get where you are. Dont give up!!",2,ToastMe
"Collage is so hard my guy, I get it, but you are far from stagnant. Kids and marriage and houses is great and all, but you have so much freedom right now, enjoy it!!! Settle down when you’re ready and don’t worry about what other people feel you should be doing, only worry about what makes you happy and fulfilled. 

Btw, you’re literally glowing! Your smile is infectious. Trust me, when you are really to settle down, you won’t have much problem. Keep doing what makes you happy handsome!",2,ToastMe

"You’ll get there bro. Remember your life can change in the blink of an eye. You can find someone you love and someone who loves you in a matter of seconds, you can achieve anything. Do not let other peoples timelines affect your life. Live everyday well, and much luck to you with your profession.",2,ToastMe

 So close, you wouldn’t have made it this far if you weren’t believed in.

"What’s your PhD in? Throughout my highschool career, I’ve always had a certain affinity for those who made it farthest in academia. My best example of this would be my statistics teacher who was the first to attend college in his family and graduate from an Ivy League University and then go on for his masters at another prestigious institution, for a lot of people, you are the person they wish they were or aspire to be. Before my Junior year of high school I had 0 aspirations for where I was going to go in life, that all changed when I sat down and talked with the teacher I mentioned above. My aspirations are now to progress through higher end academia studying my passion and to one day make it to where he was at one point, and where you are today! 


Remember that you’ve gotten farther than most will ever dream of in terms of academia, that’s a real accomplishment.",2,ToastMe

"If memory serve me educational attainment level for PhD is roughly 2% of population. It is very common for people in the program to experience imposter syndrome. Ironically it is way more common for those doing well to go through it. The nature of the situation is that these are the things you should feel if you are on the forefront. Things are difficult, poorly documented if you are researching that which is poorly understood or not known.

I had a professor who once told me that we got our bachelors around the time we thought we knew everything. Our masters when we realized we knew nothing and our doctorate when we realized no one else knew anything either.

Many never adapt and there is a reason half never make it. I know more than a few that once they understood what they felt was normal, expected and natural given the situation had an easier time handle it. To what extent it is possible, enjoy your journey towards the 2% when you can :)",2,ToastMe
You can do it! You’re heaps smarter than you think and it always seems impossible until its done! Proud of you :),2,ToastMe
"And I am proud of YOU! Damn boy, a PHD, do you even realise? It seems very meaningless to you but this makes you an amazingly intelligent person and I really wish you aaaaall the best! You'll find the one that will make you happy, don't worry! But until you find that person, please take care of yourself, you look like an amazing person.",2,ToastMe
"You’re definitely not stagnating. You’re working on getting a PhD and learning more about the world. It doesn’t feel like it right now, but trust me that you are learning and developing on a different path than everyone else, and you’re fucking awesome for it.

This is also coming from someone who thought that the only way to measure my own self-worth and self-improvement was through comparisons and competition, don’t compare your path of life to others.

Everyone is working and searching for their own answer and you are working on yours. Plus your is a wonderful one at that. 

You’re a handsome dude still in the prime of his life, with two more fantastic years in the upper echelons of an institution people dream of getting into. Once these years are over, you’re going to have stories to tell about “back when i was working on my PhD,” and you’ve permanently earned the title of Doctor before your name. 

You’re an amazing person and you’re doing amazing things. You got this.",2,ToastMe
