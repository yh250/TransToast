# TrasnToast
Converting the Roast and toast model to a transformer based context aware model 
# Description 
Previously we created a sentiment analysis model that that classfied text into Roasts or Toasts, It was based on GloVe with a neural network. it lacked contextual awarness of text semnatics, thus to overcome the shortcomings we transfered our project to transfomer based model using BERT for tockenisation along with a Bidirectional LSTM for learning.
